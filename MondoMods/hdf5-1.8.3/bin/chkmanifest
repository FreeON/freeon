# Purpose: Extract filenames from the svn v1.3.* entries file
# $1: directory name in which the svn entries is.
# steps:
# 1. remove all single line entries so that step 2 does not fail on them. 
# 2. merge all multiple lines entries into single lines.
# 3. remove all non file entries.
# 4. insert a blank line because some entries files has no kind="file"
#    entry and ed does not like to do g on an empty file.
# 5. remove everything except the file name.
# 6. remove all blank lines, including the inserted one.
