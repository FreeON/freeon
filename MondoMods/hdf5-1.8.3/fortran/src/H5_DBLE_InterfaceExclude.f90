! NAME
!   H5_DBLE_INTERFACE
!  
! FUNCTION
!   This module is used for when the default REAL is of type DOUBLE PRECISION.
!   We do not include the double precision interfaces if the defaut REAL is
!   DOUBLE PRECISION since this would lead to a non-unique conflict with the
!   generic interfaces declared as REAL and those declared as DOUBLE PRECISION.
!
! NOTES
!   Empty module.
