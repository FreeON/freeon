!
! NAME
!  H5test_kind
!  
! FUNCTION
!  This stand alone program is used at build time to generate the program 
!  H5fortran_detect.f90. It cycles through all the available KIND parameters for
!  integers and reals. The appropriate program and subroutines are then generated 
!  depending on which of the KIND values are found.
!
! NOTES
!  This program is depreciated in favor of H5test_kind_SIZEOF.f90 and is only 
!  used when the Fortran intrinsic function SIZEOF is not available. It generates
!  code that does not make use of SIZEOF in H5fortran_detect.f90 which is less 
!  portable in comparison to using SIZEOF.
!
!  The availability of SIZEOF is checked at configure time and the TRUE/FALSE 
!  condition is set in the configure variable "FORTRAN_HAVE_SIZEOF".
