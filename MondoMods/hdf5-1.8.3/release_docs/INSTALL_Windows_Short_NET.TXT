*       Build and Install HDF5 C/C++ Library with VS .NET 2003         *

************************************************************************

Notes: This short instruction is written for users who want to quickly
       build HDF5 library and tools from the HDF5 source code package
       with Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 but do not want to know 
       HDF5 building and installation details on Windows XP.
       
       Visual Studio .NET 2003 is NOT supported on Windows Vista, as Microsoft
       has ended their support.  Also, we do not support building 64-bit
       libraries or Fortran libraries with Visual Studio .NET 2003.  If you
       need any of these features, please upgrade to Visual STudio 2005.
         
       For detailed HDF5 build and install information, or if you have
       trouble following any steps in the instructions, please refer to
       INSTALL_Windows.txt for further information.
      
       For users who would like to build and test HDF5 package from the
       command line, please refer to
       INSATLL_Windows_From_Command_Line.txt.  Note, however, that building
       from the command line requires Visual Studio 2005.

WARNINGS:

Please read CAREFULLY about HDF5 build and install preconditions and 
notes in INSTALL_Windows.txt before starting below procedures.


========================================================================
                            Preconditions                                                           
========================================================================                          

   1. Set up path for external libraries and headers                     
                                                                         
      Skip this part if you don't want to use ANY compression features     
      provided by HDF5.  Please do read Section V in INSTALL_Windows.txt.                         
                                                                         
      You have to read this part even if you want to only use Zlib         
      or Szip.  You also need to read Section V in INSTALL_Windows.txt.                           
                                                                         
      Invoke Microsoft Visual C++ .Net and go to "Tools" and select             
      "Options". In the left pane of  "Option" window poped up,
      choose and expand "Projects", Click on "VC++ Directories".
      In the right pane, Find the box "Show directories for", choose                          
      "Include files", if you can not find your Zlib and Szip              
      header path                                                          
      (for example, c:\zlib123\include, c:\szip\include)                   
      from the directory list, add the header path                         
      (c:\zlib123\include, c:\szip\include) to the                         
      included directories.                                                
                                                                         
      Find the box "Show directories for", choose "Library files",         
      If you cannot find your Zlib and Szip library path                   
      (for example, c:\zlib123\dll, c:\szip\dll)                           
      from the directory list, add the library path                        
      (c:\zlib123\dll, c:\szip\dll) to the library directories.            

========================================================================
                Building HDF5 C/C++ Libraries with VS .NET
========================================================================

   1. Run batch file copy_hdf.bat

      Go to  c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\windows and run copy_hdf.bat. This process will 
      copy all the necessary batch files, windows specific source codes and 
      text files saved under c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\windows directory to the 
      corresponding directories under hdf5.

   2. Invoke Microsoft Visual Studio compiler

      Invoke Microsoft Visual Studio.  From the main menu, go to "File" and 
      select the "Open Solution" option. Then open the
      c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\windows_vnet\proj\all\all.dsw workspace.

      You should find Windows project files listed as "all", "big", etc. on the
      left.

   3. (Optional) Disable HDF5 C++ and High level C++
   
      In HDF5 1.8, C++ and HL C++ libraries are built by default.  To opt-out,
      you must explicitly disable them.

      4.1 Skip this step if you do want to build HDF5 High-Level C++ libraries

          Go to "Project" and select "Project Dependencies".  Select "all", and 
          disable all of the following projects:

            hdf5_hl_cpp
            hdf5_hl_cppdll
            hl_test_table_cpp
            hl_test_table_cppdll
      
      4.2 Skip this step if you do want to build HDF5 High-Level libraries

          Go to "Project" and select "Project Dependencies".  Select "all", and 
          disable all of the project files listed in the previous step, as well
          as the following projects:

             hdf5_hl
             hdf5_hldll
             hl_test_image
             hl_test_imagedll
             hl_test_lite
             hl_test_litedll
             hl_test_table
             hl_test_tabledll
             hl_test_ds
             hl_test_dsdll
             hl_test_packet
             hl_test_packetdll
   
   Click on "OK", From the main menu, choose "Build"-> "Build" or  
   "Rebuild ALL" to build both release and debug version of HDF5   
   Libraries.                                                                                           
             

   4. Select "Build", then Select "Configuration Manager".

      5.1 To build debug static libraries, debug multithreaded DLLs, and tests:

      In "Active Solution Configuration", select "Debug". Select "Close". 
      Select "Build" -> "Build Solution" or "Rebuild Solution" to build debug 
      version of project "all".

      5.2 To build release static libraries, multithreaded DLLs and tests:

      In "Active Solution Configuration", select "Release". Select "Close". 
      Select "Build" -> "Build Solution" or "Rebuild Solution" to build release 
      version of project "all".

      Both debug and release versions must be built.

      Warning messages can be ignored.
             
========================================================================
               Testing HDF5 C/C++ Libraries with VS .NET
========================================================================

HDF5 libraries and tools should be tested to make sure that they were
built correctly. c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\hdf5check.bat was provided to test
HDF5 libraries and tools.

hdf5check.bat has the following options:
   
   hdf5check                     test HDF5 C library and tools only
      
   hdf5check enablecpp           test HDF5 C/C++ libraries and tools


Invoke a command prompt window and run hdf5check with appropriate option.
Users are encouraged to pipe the test output into a file.  You should find
no "*FAILED*" marks.

If you want to test HDF5 libraries and tools one by one, please refer to
Section II, step 2 in INSTALL_Windows.txt.


========================================================================
                    Installing HDF5 C/C++ Libraries
========================================================================

Run the batch file c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\installhdf5lib.bat to install 
all HDF5 libraries and tools into c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\hdf5lib directory.

========================================================================
               Building HDF5 Examples and Applications
========================================================================

Building HDF5 Examples is Optional. Please read Section II, step 4 and 
the following part in INSTALL_Windows.txt for detailed information.
