*DECK INITDS
      FUNCTION INITDS (OS, NOS, ETA)
C***BEGIN PROLOGUE  INITDS
C***PURPOSE  Determine the number of terms needed in an orthogonal
C            polynomial series so that it meets a specified accuracy.
C***LIBRARY   SLATEC (FNLIB)
C***CATEGORY  C3A2
C***TYPE      DOUBLE PRECISION (INITS-S, INITDS-D)
C***KEYWORDS  CHEBYSHEV, FNLIB, INITIALIZE, ORTHOGONAL POLYNOMIAL,
C             ORTHOGONAL SERIES, SPECIAL FUNCTIONS
C***AUTHOR  Fullerton, W., (LANL)
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  Initialize the orthogonal series, represented by the array OS, so
C  that INITDS is the number of terms needed to insure the error is no
C  larger than ETA.  Ordinarily, ETA will be chosen to be one-tenth
C  machine precision.
C
C             Input Arguments --
C   OS     double precision array of NOS coefficients in an orthogonal
C          series.
C   NOS    number of coefficients in OS.
C   ETA    single precision scalar containing requested accuracy of
C          series.
