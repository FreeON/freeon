\section{Introduction}
 Electronic structure theory based on the first principle 
 of physics was for long time limitied to the study of small 
 systems with only a small number of nonequivalent atoms. 
 Despite a tremendous increase in computational power
 of digital computers this would still be a severe limitation
 if not more efficient theoretical and computational
 tools were developed. During the last 10 years a new paradigm 
 has evolved in electronic structure theory, where
 no single part of a calculation is allowed to increase in 
 computational complexity more than linearly with the number
 of atoms. 

 Algorithms in linear scaling self-consistent-field (SCF) theory 
 exploit the quantum locality (or nearsightedness) of non-metallic systems, 
 manifested in the approximate exponential decay of the density matrix 
 with atom-atom separation, through the effective use of sparse 
 matrix methods. For small systems this is usually an inefficient
 approach, but for large systems consisting of millions
 of atoms it will have a major future impact, bridging the gap
 between material science, chemistry and biology. So far, most 
 attentions in linear scaling electronic structure
 theory has been focused on total energy calculations and little
 attention has been devoted to the problem of materials response
 properties, such as magnetic and electric responses or nuclear
 displacement. However, the locality principle is extandable
 also to response properties. In previous studies linear scaling 
 for the calculation of response propertie was demonstrated for one
 dimensional linear chain systems (CHECK IT)
 \cite{Ochsenfeld_1997,Ochsenfeld_1998,chintoc}. Recently
 a perturbed projection algorithm was proposed for low order
 response properties for which linear scaling was demonstrated
 also for three dimensional systems \cite{Weber_Niklasson_Challacombe_2004}.

 In the calculation of materials response properties within 
 Hartree-Fock or density functional theory the electronic
 response is given from self-consistent solutions of both
 the ground state density and its perturbative response functions,
 refered to as the solutions to the coupled perturbed self consistent 
 field (CPSCF) equations.
 Standard non-linear scaling approaches to solutions of the CPSCF equations 
 \cite{Pople_1979,Sekino_1986,Dupuis_1991} do not admit full exploitation 
 of locality and sparse matrix algebra, as they are based on perturbation 
 of the wave functions, requiring a solution of the eigenvalue problem
 that scales as ${\cal O}(N^3)$ and with transformation of two-electron
 integrals that typically scales as ${\cal O}(N^5)$ with system size.
 These problems are avoided in a density matrix approach, where both
 the density matrix and its derivatives are calculated directly.
 A few linear scaling response schemes have been proposed.
 Ochsenfeld and Head-Gordon developed a scheme based on the
 Li-Nunes-Vanderbilt density matrix functional \cite{Ochsenfeld_1997}
 and later Larsen {\em et al.} \cite{Helgaker_2001} proposed iterative 
 solutions to the CPSCF equations based on unitary operations
 invovling matrix exponentials. In both of these approaches, a linear 
 system of equations containing commutation relations must be solved.
 Another very interesting approach was demonstrated by Chintoc, who
 derived the frequency response of one dimensional molecular chains
 by calculating the time evolution of the density matrix from
 the quantum-Liouville equation.

 Our approach to linear scaling response theory is quite different 
 from previous attempts. It is based on the perturbed projection
 method in density matrix perturbation theory, recently developed
 by the authors \cite{Niklasson04,Weber04}. With this theory it
 was possible to demonstrate efficient linear scaling {\em ab initio}
 computations for the first electric polarizability of three-dimensional 
 water clusters.

 In this article, we present a linear scaling self consisitent sheme
 for higher order response peoperties up fourth order in energy.
 First we give a general description through the solution of the CPSCF equations.
 Then we describe the perturbed projection approach for the calculation
 of the density matrix derivatives and present
 an algorithm for derivatives up to third order.
 Thereafter, we derive a density matrix analogy to Wigner's 2n+1
 rule for nonorthogonal representations. We also briefly discuss the
 self concistent accelaration technique by Weber and ... . In the next section,
 we first show the saturation of the hyperpolarizabilities up to fourth order
 for a series of 1D chain of water molecules. Thereafter, we demonstate
 linear scaling computation of the higher order electric response properties
 for 3D water clusters.



\section{CPSCF equations}
The coupled perturbed self concistent field equations occur in Hartree-Fock
and density functional theory for the computation of material response
properties. Here, we discuss the CPSCF equation in the framework of
HF theory, however an extension to DFT is straightforward.


The following schematic algorithm is a higher order generalization of the
SC scheme for the solution of the CPSCF equations descibe in \cite{SV} 
based on perturbed pronjection:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{eqnarray}
&&  F^{ab\ldots}_{n}=\mu_a+J(D^{ab\ldots}_n)+K(D^{ab\ldots}_n) \label{FockBuild} \\
&& \displaystyle\widetilde{F}^{ab\ldots}_{n}=\sum_{k=n-m}^{n}c_k F^{ab\ldots}_{k} \label{DDIIS} \\
&& \displaystyle\mathcal{D}^{ab\ldots}_{n+1}=
  \frac{\partial^N}{\partial\mathcal{E}^a \partial\mathcal{E}^b\ldots}
     \theta(\tilde{\mu}I-(\mathcal{F}^{0}
     +\mathcal{E}^{a}\widetilde{\mathcal{F}}^{a}_n
     +\mathcal{E}^{b}\widetilde{\mathcal{F}}^{b}_n+\ldots))
     \bigg|_{\mathcal{E}=0} \label{DDeriv}
   \end{eqnarray} 
\end{subequations}

The scheme solves for the self concistent density response, \\
first... Linear scaling construction of the Fockian expansion follows in
the same way as the O(N) construction of the Fockian cite{Matt...}\\
second... DDIIS optimizing scheme based on DIIS.\\
third... density matrix derivative through perturbation projection.\\


%with starting point $D^a_0=0$. In step~(\ref{FockBuild}),  $F^a_n$ is constructed in 
%${\cal O}(N)$ using algorithms \cite{MChallacombe97,ESchwegler97} in 
%the {\sc MondoSCF} \cite{MondoSCF} suite of linear scaling quantum chemistry programs.

\subsubsection{Higher order response and Wigner's 2n+1 rule }
Higher order energy derivatives can be calculated from the lower
order response. Wigner's 2n+1 rule gives a general way to calculate the 2n+1
energy response from the n-th order response. A density matrix analogy to
the Wigner's 2n+1 rule was given in cite{...}, here we will present
a generalization to the non orthogonal case for mixte derivatives 
up to fourth order....

10-th order (at least +2n+1 til 21-th order in E (for Anders)).
\subsection{Linear scaling: 3D water clusters}
3D water clusters show an early onset of linear scaling for accrurate
basis set and low tresholds and higher order response.

The density responses matrices show an exponential decay as a function
of the internuclear distance, however the decay is slower and the locality
becomes lower for the higher order response functions.
Therefor, we find a later onset for the linear scaling for the higher order
responses.

\subsection{Linear scaling: 3D water clusters}
3D water clusters show an early onset of linear scaling for accrurate
basis set and low tresholds and higher order response.

The density responses matrices show an exponential decay as a function
of the internuclear distance, however the decay is slower and the locality
becomes lower for the higher order response functions.
Therefor, we find a later onset for the linear scaling for the higher order
responses.

\section{Sumary and Conclusion}


 We have proposed and demonstreted a linear scaling self
 consisitent sheme for high order response peoperties.
 The sheme solves the coupled perturbed self consitent field 
 equation by the perturbed projection method.


% It is applied to the computation
% of the first and second electric hyperpolarizabilities of three
% dimensional water clusters. Linear scaling and locality of the response
% densities are demonstrated.
