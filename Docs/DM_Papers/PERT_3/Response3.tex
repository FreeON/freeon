\section{Introduction}
 Electronic structure theory based on the first principle 
 of physics was for long time limited to the study of small 
 systems with only a small number of nonequivalent atoms. 
 Despite a tremendous increase in computational power
 of digital computers this would still be a severe limitation
 if not more efficient theoretical and computational
 tools were developed. During the last 10 years a new paradigm 
 has evolved in electronic structure theory, where
 no single part of a calculation is allowed to increase in 
 computational complexity more than linearly with the number
 of atoms. 

 Algorithms in linear scaling self-consistent-field (SCF) theory 
 exploit the quantum locality (or nearsightedness) of non-metallic systems, 
 manifested in the approximate exponential decay of the density matrix 
 with atom-atom separation, through the effective use of sparse 
 matrix methods. For small systems this is usually an inefficient
 approach, but for large systems consisting of millions
 of atoms it will have a major future impact, bridging the gap
 between material science, chemistry and biology. So far, most 
 attentions in linear scaling electronic structure
 theory has been focused on total energy calculations and little
 attention has been devoted to the problem of materials response
 properties, such as magnetic and electric responses or nuclear
 displacement. However, the locality principle is extensible
 also to response properties. In previous studies linear scaling 
 for the calculation of response properties was demonstrated for one
 dimensional linear chain systems (CHECK IT)
 \cite{Ochsenfeld97,COchsenfeld98,CYam03,CYam03a}. Recently
 a perturbed projection algorithm was proposed for low order
 response properties for which linear scaling was demonstrated
 also for three dimensional systems \cite{Weber04}.

 In the calculation of materials response properties within 
 Hartree-Fock or density functional theory the electronic
 response is given from self-consistent solutions of both
 the ground state density and its perturbative response functions,
 referred to as the solutions to the coupled perturbed self consistent 
 field (CPSCF) equations.
 Standard non-linear scaling approaches to solutions of the CPSCF equations 
 \cite{Pople_1979,Sekino_1986,Dupuis_1991} do not admit full exploitation 
 of locality and sparse matrix algebra, as they are based on perturbation 
 of the wave functions, requiring a solution of the eigenvalue problem
 that scales as ${\cal O}(N^3)$ and with transformation of two-electron
 integrals that typically scales as ${\cal O}(N^5)$ with system size.
 These problems are avoided in a density matrix approach, where both
 the density matrix and its derivatives are calculated directly.
 A few linear scaling response schemes have been proposed.
 Ochsenfeld and Head-Gordon developed a scheme based on the
 Li-Nunes-Vanderbilt density matrix functional \cite{Ochsenfeld_1997}
 and later Larsen {\em et al.} \cite{Helgaker_2001} proposed iterative 
 solutions to the CPSCF equations based on unitary operations
 involving matrix exponentials. In both of these approaches, a linear 
 system of equations containing commutation relations must be solved.
 Another very interesting approach was demonstrated by Yam and al
 \cite{CYam03,CYam03a}, who
 derived the frequency response of one dimensional molecular chains
 by calculating the time evolution of the density matrix from
 the quantum-Liouville equation.

 Our approach to linear scaling response theory is quite different 
 from previous attempts. It is based on the perturbed projection
 method in density matrix perturbation theory, recently developed
 by the authors \cite{Niklasson04,Weber04}. With this theory it
 was possible to demonstrate efficient linear scaling {\em ab initio}
 computations for the first electric polarizability of three-dimensional 
 water clusters.

 In this article, we present a linear scaling self consistent scheme
 for higher order response properties up to fourth order in energy.
 First we give a general description through the solution of the CPSCF equations.
 Then we describe the perturbed projection approach for the calculation
 of the density matrix derivatives and present
 an algorithm for derivatives up to third order in the density matrix.
 Thereafter, we derive a density matrix analogy to Wigner's 2n+1
 rule for nonorthogonal representations. We also briefly discuss the
 self consistent acceleration technique by Weber and Daul \cite{Weber_2003} . In the next section,
 we first show the saturation of the hyperpolarizabilities up to fourth order
 for a series of 1D chain of water molecules. Thereafter, we demonstrate
 linear scaling computation of the higher order electric response properties
 for 3D water clusters.


\section{CPSCF equations}
The coupled perturbed self consistent field equations occur in Hartree-Fock
and density functional theory for the computation of material response
properties. Here, we discuss the CPSCF equation in the framework of
HF theory, however an extension to DFT is straightforward.

Superscripts and subscripts refer to perturbation order and 
iteration count respectively. The symbols $\mathcal{D},\mathcal{F},\dots$
are matrices in an orthogonal representation, while
$D,F,\dots$ are the corresponding matrices in a non-orthogonal basis.
The transformation between orthogonal and non-orthogonal 
representations is carried out in ${\cal O}(N)$ using
congruence transformations \cite{JWilkinson65,GStewart73} provided 
by the AINV algorithm for computing sparse approximate inverse 
Cholesky factors \cite{MBenzi95,MBenzi96,MBenzi01}.

The total energy of a molecule in a homogenous electric field may 
be developed in a Taylor expansion as
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    E_{\rm tot}(\E)= E_{\rm tot}(0) 
    &-\sum_a\mu_a\E^a\\
    &-\frac{1}{2!}\sum_{ab}\alpha_{ab}\E^a\E^b\\
    &-\frac{1}{3!}\sum_{abc}\beta_{abc}\E^a\E^b\E^c\\
    &-\frac{1}{4!}\sum_{abcd}\gamma_{abcd}\E^a\E^b\E^c\E^d\\
    &+\dots,
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
 where $\alpha_{ab}$, $\beta_{abc}$ and $\gamma_{abcd}$ are 
 the first polarizability and the first and second 
 hyperpolarizabilities respectively, $\mu_a$ is the dipole 
 moment and $\E^a$ is the electric field in direction $a$. 

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \F(\E)=\F^{0} & +\sum_a \F^{a}\E^{a}\\
    &+\frac{1}{2!}\sum_{ab} \F^{ab}\E^{a}\E^{b}\\
    &+\frac{1}{3!}\sum_{abc} \F^{abc}\E^{a}\E^{b}\E^{c}+\dots
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
A similar expantion also holds for the density matrix $\D(\E)$.

The derivative density matrix and derivative Fockian depend on 
each other implicitly and must be solved for self-consistently 
via the coupled-perturbed self-consistent-field (CPSCF) equations.
The necessary and sufficient criteria for convergence of the 
CPSCF equations involve an extension to the SCF equations \cite{Furche_2001}
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{gather}
    [\F^{0} ,\D^{0}]=0,\\
    [\F^{a} ,\D^{0}]+[\F^{0},\D^{a}]=0,\\
    [\F^{ab},\D^{0}]+\frac{1}{2}[\F^{a},\D^{b}]+\frac{1}{2}[\F^{b} ,\D^{a}]+[\F^{0},\D^{ab}]=0,\\
    \text{May be the third order???}
  \end{gather}
\end{subequations}
and the idempotency-like constraint \cite{Furche_2001}
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{gather}
    \D^{0} =\D^{0} \D^{0},\\
    \D^{a} =\{\D^{a},\D^{0}\},\\
    \D^{ab}=\{\D^{ab},\D^{0}\}+\frac{1}{2}\{\D^{a},\D^{b}\}\\
    \D^{abc}=\{\D^{abc},\D_0\}+
        \frac{1}{3}(\{\D^{ab},\D^{c}\}+\{\D^{ac},\D^{b}\}+\{\D^{bc},\D^{a}\})
  \end{gather}
\end{subequations}
The following schematic algorithm is a higher order generalization of the
self consistent scheme for the solution of the CPSCF equations describe 
in \cite{Weber04} based on perturbed projection:
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{gather}
F^{a\ldots}_{n}= \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\mu_a+J(D^{a}_n)+K(D^{a}_n), & N=1\label{FockBuild},\\
J(D^{a\ldots}_n)+K(D^{a\ldots}_n), & N>1.
\end{array}\right.\\
%    F^{a}_{n}=\mu_a+J(D^{a}_n)+K(D^{a}_n) \label{FockBuild} \\
%    F^{ab\ldots}_{n}=J(D^{ab\ldots}_n)+K(D^{ab\ldots}_n) \label{FockBuild2} \\
    \displaystyle\widetilde{F}^{a\ldots}_{n}=\sum_{k=n-m}^{n}c_k F^{a\ldots}_{k} \label{DDIIS} \\
    \displaystyle\D^{a\ldots}_{n+1}=
    \frac{\partial^N}{\partial\E^a\ldots}\theta(\tilde{\mu}I-
    \F(\E))\bigg|_{\E=0} \label{DDeriv}
%    (\F^{0}+\sum_c\E^{c}\widetilde{\F}^{c}_n+\ldots))\bigg|_{\E=0} \label{DDeriv}
  \end{gather} 
\end{subequations}
with starting points $D^{a\ldots}_0=0$. In step~(\ref{FockBuild}),  
$F^a_n$ is constructed in ${\cal O}(N)$ using algorithms 
\cite{MChallacombe97,ESchwegler97} in the {\sc MondoSCF} \cite{MondoSCF} 
suite of linear scaling quantum chemistry programs.  Next,
Weber and Daul's DDIIS algorithm for convergence acceleration 
of the CPSCF equation \cite{Weber_2003} is used to optimize 
the $c_k$ coefficients in step~(\ref{DDIIS}).

    \X^{ab}_{i+1}&=\{\X^{ab}_{i},\X^0_{i}\}+\frac{1}{2}\{\X^a_{i},\X^b_{i}\}\\
    \X^a_{i+1}&=\{\X^a_{i},\X^0_{i}\}\\
    \X^b_{i+1}&=\{\X^b_{i},\X^0_{i}\}\\
    \X^0_{i+1}&=(\X^0_{i})^2
  \end{array} 
  \right\}\quad \Tr[\X^0_{i}]\ge N_e 
\end{equation}
or 
\begin{equation}\label{PP2}
  \left.
  \begin{array}{ll}
    \X^a_{i+1}&=2 \X^a_{i}-{\X^a_{i},\X^0_{i}} \\
    \X^0_{i+1}&=2 \X^0_{i}-(\X^0_{i})^2
  \end{array} 
  \right\}\quad \Tr[X^0_{i}]< N_e.
\end{equation}


The matrices initiating the sequence are obtained from $\F^0$,
and $\F^{a\ldots}$ by appropriately
compressing their spectrum into the domain of convergence
\cite{ANiklasson02A} using
\begin{equation}
  \X^0_{0}=\frac{\F_{max}-\F^0}{\F_{max}-\F_{min}}~{\rm and}~
  \X^{a\ldots}_{0}=\frac{\F^{a\ldots}_{n}}{\F_{min}-\F_{max}},
\end{equation}
where $\F_{min}$ and $\F_{max}$ are approximate upper and lower 
bounds of the eigenvalues of $\F^0$.

\subsubsection{Higher order response and Wigner's 2n+1 rule }
Higher order energy derivatives can be calculated from the lower
order response. Wigner's 2n+1 rule gives a general way to calculate the 2n+1
energy response from the n-th order response. These kind of expressions
based on the wave function perturbation theory are well known and are 
descibed in for exemple \cite{Dupuis_1991}.
A density matrix analogy to 
The Wigner's 2n+1 rule was given in cite{...}, here we will present
a generalization to the non orthogonal case for mixed derivatives 
up to fourth order....

\section{Examples}
To demonstrate the ability, accuracy, numerical stability and efficiency 
of the algorithm we present
the solution of the 10th order UPSCF (Uncoupled Perturbed SCF) 
equation for the $\rm C_{60}$ and for one dimensional water chains. 
Then the CPSCF equations are solved up to third order for the one dimensional 
water chains and the results obtained are compared with the 2n+1 rule presented 
above and with GAMESS calculations \cite{gamess}. We have also performed polarizabilities
calculations up to third order on a series of water clusters at standard 
liquid density \cite{MChallacombe97,ESchwegler97}, up to $(\rm H_2O)_{150}$. 

Calculations were carried out on a single Intel Xeon 2.4GHz processor 
running RedHat Linux 8.0 and  executables compiled
with Portland Group Fortran Compiler pgf90 4.0-2 \cite{PGF90}.

We have computed the (hyper)polarizabilities $\alpha_{zz}$, 
$\beta_{zzz}$ and $\gamma_{zzzz}$ of water oligomers containing
up to fourty water molecules. These calculations have been carried out at
both the RHF/6-31G and RHF/6-31G** levels of
theory and at the {\tt TIGHT} thresholding parameter 
that control precision of the linear scaling algorithms.
The static properties of water chains have been evaluated
by using the same geometry as Otto et al \cite{POtto00}. We also
present the results obtained with the density matrix based 2n+1 rule.
We also draw comparison with the results obtained with the GAMESS 
quantum chemistry package \cite{gamess} at the RHF/6-31G level of theory.

\subsection{Linear scaling: 3D water clusters}

3D water clusters show an early onset of linear scaling for accurate
basis set and low thresholds and higher order response.


Calculations have been carried out at both the RHF/6-31G and RHF/6-31G** levels of
theory and at both the {\tt GOOD} and {\tt TIGHT} thresholding parameter 
sets that control precision of the linear scaling algorithms, corresponding 
to matrix thresholds of $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-6}$, respectively.



\subsection{Exponential decay}
Figure \ref{fig:Superposition_Decay} shows the superposition 
of the magnitude of density matrix derivative atom-atom blocks up to 
third order as a function of atom-atom distance when perturbed by 
a static electric field. 
The density responses matrices show an exponential decay as a function
of the internuclear distance, however the decay is slower and the locality
becomes lower for the higher order response functions.
Therefor, we find a later onset for the linear scaling for the higher order
responses.

\section{Summary and Conclusion}


 We have proposed and demonstrated a linear scaling self
 consistent scheme for high order response properties.
 The scheme solves the coupled perturbed self consistent field 
 equation by the perturbed projection method. We have also shown
 that the perturbed projection method can be expended to high
 order (e.g. up to 10-th order in the present paper).

We have presented a simple and efficient algorithm for solution 
of the coupled-perturbed self-consistent-field (CPSCF) equations 
in the context of spectral projection and static
electric polarizabilities. Unique features of the perturbed 
projection algorithm include linear scaling, simplicity, numerical 
stability and quadratic convergence in computation of the derivative
density matrices.

We have shown that the density matrix response is local 
upon {\em global} electric perturbation, corresponding to an approximate 
exponential decay of matrix elements. A similar exponential decay
in the first order response corresponding to the {\em local} nuclear 
displacement has previously been demonstrated by Ochsenfeld and 
Head-Gordon \cite{Ochsenfeld_1997}. These key observations are expected to
hold generally for both local and global perturbations to insulating systems.  
We note also that the method is not unique to the TC2 generator or 
{\sc MondoSCF} $N$-scaling algorithms, but can be straightforwardly 
extended to other purification schemes such as TRS4 \cite{ANiklasson03} as
well as other electronic structure programs.

Convergence of the CPSCF equations for these systems (water cluster ...)
are typically achived in about 10 cycles, independent of cluster size, basis set,
matrix threshold or order of the response calculated.
