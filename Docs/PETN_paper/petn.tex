\begin{abstract}
All-electron calculations of the hydrostatic compression of
pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) crystal have been performed using
density functional theory with the PBE functional in conjunction with
the 6-31G** Gaussian basis set.  Full optimizations of the atomic
positions and $c/a$ ratio of lattice parameters for the tetragonal
crystal were performed for eight volume ratios $0.65
\le V/V_0 \le 1.00$, where $V_0$ is the equilibrium volume at zero
pressure.  The pressure, linear compressibilities of lattice
parameters $a$ and $c$, and $c/a$ ratio as functions of volume ratio
are found to be in good agreement with experiment.  Changes in
intramolecular coordinates and close intermolecular contact distances
were studied as a function of compression.  Predictions of the bulk
modulus $\Bulk$ and its pressure derivative $\BPrime$ were obtained
using various equation of state fitting forms.

\section{Introduction}
Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN, $C(CH_2ONO_2)_4$) is an important
secondary high explosive.  At room temperature, PETN crystallizes in a
tetragonal space group, P$\bar{4}$2$_1$c, with two molecules per unit
cell\cite{Booth_1947v,Trotter_1963v16,Conant_1979}.  A
high-temperature form denoted PETN-II has also been
reported.\cite{Cady_1975vB41} PETN has received a lot of attention due
to interesting anisotropic, non-monotonic shock initiation
sensitivity.\cite{Dick_1984v44,Dick_1991v70,Gallagher_1992v339,Dick_1997v81,Gruzdkov_2000v104,Yoo_2000v88}
The room temperature linear and volumetric hydrostatic compression of
PETN has been measured by Olinger and
co-workers\cite{Olinger_1975v62,Olinger_1976} using x-ray diffraction
for pressures up to 10.45~GPa.  Dick and von Dreele\cite{Dick_1997}
used neutron scattering from deuterated PETN to study detailed
pressure-induced changes in dihedral angles and molecular orientations
in the unit cell for pressures up to 4.28~GPa.  It is interesting to
note that, while the volumetric compression reported by Dick and von
Dreele was consistent with the data of Olinger {\it et al.},
significant differences were observed in the linear compressions along
the $a$ and $c$ axes.

A complete set of isentropic elastic coefficients for PETN was
reported by Morris\cite{Morris_1976} based on extensive single crystal
sound speed measurements.  The resulting elastic tensor was of high
precision with the exception of element $C_{13}$, which had an
uncertainty over ten times the average for the others.  Winey and
Gupta\cite{Winey_2001v90} re-analyzed Morris' data, identified the
source of the inconsistency in $C_{13}$, and reported an internally
consistent and precise elastic tensor.

There have been a number of theoretical studies of PETN crystals based
on analytic classical potentials.  Dick and Ritchie\cite{Dick_1994v76}
performed molecular mechanics calculations using the AMBER4.0 force
field to study the energetics associated with slip along specific
directions in the crystal, in an effort to understand the anisotropic
initiation sensitivity in PETN.  Their results were largely consistent
with experimental data, but were not conclusive due to the lack of
rate-dependent information. 

Theoretical predictions of PETN crystal structure, thermal expansion,
and hydrostatic compression were reported by Sorescu {\it et
al.}\cite{Sorescu_1999v103A, Sorescu_1999v103} They used an
intermolecular potential function developed in their laboratory in
conjunction with a rigid-molecule approximation for the molecular
structure. Agreement to within one percent of the measured crystal
lattice parameters was obtained at 300~K, although the calculated
thermal expansion was three times smaller than the experimental value.
Sorescu {\it et al.}\cite{Sorescu_1999v103} predicted linear
compressibilities that were in reasonable agreement with experiment
for pressures below 6~GPa, with the onset of significant discrepancies
for higher pressures.  (The calculated linear compressibilities were
systematically lower than measured ones, resulting in a larger error
in the volumetric compressibility over the entire pressure interval;
which led to a 41\% error compared to experiment in the predicted
initial bulk modulus.) The authors attributed the errors in their
predictions away from ambient conditions to a shortcoming of the
rigid-molecule approximation.

Bunte and Sun\cite{Bunte_2000v104} reported a flexible molecule inter-
and intramolecular COMPASS force field parameterization based on a
calibration to experimental data and high level gas phase electronic
structure results for selected nitrate esters.  Although PETN was not
part of the force field training set, predicted crystal lattice
parameters for PETN were in good agreement with experiment.  Bunte and
Sun reported five of the six elastic coefficients for PETN at zero
Kelvin, based on energy-minimized lattice parameters as well as for a
constrained calculation in which the lattice parameters were set equal
to experimental values.  Reasonable agreement with experimental data
was obtained in the latter case, in spite of neglect of explicit
thermal effects.  Since they did not report the $C_{13}$ elastic
coefficient, it is not possible to obtain a bulk modulus from their
work.

Zaoui and Sekkal\cite{Zaoui_2001v118} reported calculations of PETN
thermal and mechanical properties using a flexible, Tersoff-like force
field.  This work is difficult to interpret, as the primary simulation
cell as described in the article corresponds to a non-integral number
of molecules, and the predicted longitudinal and transverse sound
speeds are both unrealistically small and inconsistent with the bulk
modulus they report.  For these reasons, it will not be considered
further below.

In this contribution, we report condensed phase electronic-structure
calculations of the hydrostatic compression of PETN at absolute zero
and pressures up to 25 GPa.  We employ an all-electron
density-functional method using the PBE functional in conjunction with
the 6-31G** Gaussian basis set.  Complete optimization of the cell
contents and $c/a$ ratio of the lattice parameters is performed at
each of the eight volumes considered, assuming a tetragonal cell
(i.e., $a=b \neq c$, $\alpha=\beta=\gamma=90^\circ$).  It should be
noted that our all-electron treatment is considerably more demanding
computationally than pseudopotential methods, but it should be free
from potential errors associated with pseudopotentials that would
likely become important at high pressures.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In
Section~\ref{sec:comput} we describe the computational framework and
in Section~\ref{sec:protocol} the details of our calculations. In
Section~\ref{sec:results} we present the results of the calculations
and properties derived from them, with comparisons to experiment and
previous theoretical studies.  Finally, in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} we summarize the main conclusions of our
work.

\section{Computational Framework}
\label{sec:comput}
Calculations were performed using a parallelized version of
MondoSCF,\cite{MondoSCF} a suite of programs for linear scaling
electronic-structure theory and {\it ab initio} molecular dynamics.
This code employs a number of advanced $O(N)$ techniques such as the
quantum chemistry tree code (QCTC) for the Coulomb matrix build
\cite{MChallacombe96,MChallacombe96B,MChallacombe97} and
the adaptive Hierarchical Cubature (HiCu) for the exchange-correlation
matrix build.~\cite{MChallacombe00A} Parallelization of MondoSCF has
been carried out, where an exemplary success is the efficient
data-parallel algorithm for the HiCu method\cite{CGan03} with an
equal-time partitioning scheme that exploits the temporal locality of
SCF calculations to achieve excellent load balance. We used a cluster
of 256 4-CPU HP/Compaq Alphaserver ES45s with the Quadrics QsNet High
Speed Interconnect to perform the calculations in this work.  Most
calculations were performed using 32 processors.

\section{Computational Protocol}
\label{sec:protocol}
The results described below are for pure, three-dimensionally periodic
gradient-corrected density-functional theory (GGA), using the PBE
functional.\cite{Perdew_96v77} A variety of split-valence Gaussian
basis sets were considered, although all of the calculations reported
here were performed with the 6-31G** basis set.

For $k$-point sampling, we primarily used the $\Gamma$ point, which is
sufficient for the purpose in this work, as confirmed by repeating
some calculations with a larger $1 \times 1 \times 2 $ supercell.
Thus, unless otherwise stated, all calculations were performed for a
primary simulation cell corresponding to one crystallographic unit
cell; i.e., a $1\times 1\times 1 $ system containing two molecules.

Starting with the experimental x-ray crystal structure reported by
Conant {\it et al.},\cite{Conant_1979} we calculated the zero pressure
unit cell volume $V_0$ under the assumption of a tetragonal lattice
($a=b\neq c$, $\alpha=\beta=\gamma=90^\circ$) by computing fully
energy-minimized structures on a $5\times 5$ grid of $a$ and $c$
lattice parameters, and fitting the results to a cubic polynomial in
$a$ and $c$.  A subsequent calculation on a $3 \times 3$ grid centered
at the minimum predicted from the preceding step was used to obtain an
improved prediction of the optimized crystal structure.  These
correspond to $a_0$, $c_0$, and $V_0=a_0^2c_0$.  Verification that the
resulting tetragonal structure is stable to non-tetragonal variations
in cell shape was performed by computing energy-minimized orthorhombic
structures, i.e., $a\neq b\neq c$, in the neighborhood of the
tetragonal minimum; these tests indicated that the tetragonal
structure is energetically favored over nearby orthorhombic ones.

Energy-minimized structures for a given volume ratio $V/V_0$ were
obtained by scanning a set of $c/a$ ratios consistent with the desired
volume $V$.  Initial guesses were obtained by rigid translation of the
molecular structure obtained from the next larger volume ratio via a
transformation that preserves the center-of-mass positions in
crystallographic coordinates.  Typically, seven values of $c/a$ were
considered at a given volume $V=a^2c$, and the results were fitted to
a parabola.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
Calculated and measured lattice parameters are compared in
Table~\ref{tab:table1}, where we also include the experimental results
of Olinger {\it et al.}\cite{Olinger_1975v62} and Conant {\it et
al.}\cite{Conant_1979}; and the theoretical predictions of Sorescu
{\it et al.}\cite{Sorescu_1999v103} and Bunte and
Sun\cite{Bunte_2000v104} for completeness.  Percent errors in our
calculations relative to the experimental results of Conant {\it et
al.}\cite{Conant_1979} are 0.51\%, 0.75\%, and 1.8\% for $a_0$, $c_0$,
and $V_0$, respectively.  It is important to note, however, that we
have not attempted to correct for thermal expansion, since
experimental coefficients of thermal expansion for PETN do not extend
to cryogenic temperatures.

Calculated intramolecular coordinates and selected intermolecular
distances are compared to the experimental results of Conant {\it et
al.}\cite{Conant_1979} in Table~\ref{tab:table2}.  The predicted
molecular geometry is in excellent agreement with experiment.  The
12\% discrepancy in the C-H distances is expected, since we are
comparing to x-ray data.  Otherwise, most of the intramolecular
degrees of freedom are accurately predicted to within a few percent.
There are three intermolecular distances less than 3~\AA\ at
equilibrium, each of which is an O$\cdot\cdot\cdot$H contact.
Predicted values are 2.396~\AA, 2.779~\AA, and 2.898~\AA, with errors
relative to experiment of $-$3.5\%, $-$0.7\%, and 0.1\%, respectively.

The volumetric hydrostatic compression is summarized in
Fig.~\ref{fig:volume_compress}.  The variation of the energy with
volume ratio is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:volume_compress}(a).  The line
is a sixth-degree polynomial fit, from which the pressure shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:volume_compress}(b) is obtained as $P=-dE/dV$.  The open
circles in Fig.~\ref{fig:volume_compress}(b) are the experimental data
of Olinger {\it et al.}, with experimental uncertainties smaller than
the symbol sizes.  The calculated volumetric compression is in
remarkably good agreement with experiment.  The effects of finite
temperature would be expected to ``soften'' the calculated isotherm at
low pressures; however, the effect should diminish quickly with
increasing compression.

data of Olinger {\it et al.}\cite{Olinger_1975v62} are smaller than

\label{fig:volume_compress}
\end{figure}

The linear compression along the $a$ and $c$ crystallographic
directions is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:linear_compress}.  We show in
Fig.~\ref{fig:linear_compress}(a) the relative compressions of $a/a_0$
and $c/c_0$.  Calculated values are indicated by open symbols.
Crosses and stars denote the experimental data of Olinger {\it et
al.};\cite{Olinger_1975v62} as before, experimental uncertainties are
smaller than the symbols.  In Fig.~\ref{fig:linear_compress}(b) we
show the variation of the $c/a$ ratio as a function of compression.
Open squares are calculated values; open circles were derived from the
data of Olinger {\it et al.};\cite{Olinger_1975v62} uncertainties in
the experimental ratios indicated by the error bars are shown for
representative cases.  The solid line is based on polynomial
representations of $a=a(V)$ and $c=c(V)$ due to Olinger {\it et
al.}\cite{Olinger_1975v62} We observe in both cases an initial
decrease in the $c/a$ ratio with increasing compression, followed by
an increase toward a more ``cubic-like'' lattice structure.  The
positions of the minima in the curves are in fairly good agreement,
and correspond to a volume ratio of 0.8 and a pressure of about 7~GPa.

%As expected, most of the change with increasing compression is associated
%with intermolecular packing.  At zero pressure there are only twenty four
%bonds per unit cell with $R_{ij} < $3.0 \AA.  At 25 GPa, this number has
%increased to 140.

\label{fig:intramolecular}
\end{figure}
In Figs.~\ref{fig:intramolecular}(a) and (b), we show the changes in
intramolecular bond lengths and three-center angles as PETN is
compressed.  For clarity of presentation, we only include results that
show significant changes.
%Dihedral angles are not included, as they only exhibit
%small changes.  (This result is at odds with the experimental study of
%Dick and von Dreele,\cite{Dick_1997} who reported variations of up to 
%several degrees in some of the dihedral angles in PETN-{\it d8} between 
%zero and 4.28 GPa.) 
It is observed that the bond lengths and angles remain almost constant
for $ 0.8 \leq V/V_0 \leq 1.0$, with the onset of sizable changes for
higher levels of compression.  Figure~\ref{fig:intramolecular}(c)
depicts the response of the three sets of intermolecular distances
that are below 3 \AA\/ at zero pressure; each of these corresponds to
an O$\cdot\cdot\cdot$H interaction.  The two longer distances decrease
essentially linearly over the entire interval of compression studied,
whereas the shorter one exhibits an obvious change in slope at about
$V/V_0=0.8$, which we once again note is the volume ratio
corresponding to the minimum in $c/a$.


The results in Fig.~\ref{fig:intramolecular} are consistent with the
discussion of Pastine and Bernecker,\cite{Pastine_1974v45} who argued
that the initial compression of an organic explosive is due almost
entirely to reduction of intermolecular distances.  At higher
pressures, the energetic cost of further reduction of intermolecular
distances becomes comparable to that associated with distortions of
intramolecular degrees of freedom.  From our calculations, we conclude
that this transition occurs at approximately 7~GPa (see
Fig.~\ref{fig:volume_compress}(b)).  Interestingly, Sorescu {\it et
al.}\cite{Sorescu_1999v103} observed that the deviations under
hydrostatic compression of their simulated lattice parameters from the
experimental values increases rapidly for pressures above 6~GPa.  They
attributed this to a shortcoming of the rigid-molecule approximation
used in their work, and the present results would seem to corroborate
this conclusion.  Intuitively, one might expect a range of pressures
over which different kinds of intramolecular degrees of freedom become
involved, with dihedral, three-center angle, and covalent bond
distortions emerging at successively higher pressures.  That this is
evidently not the case for PETN may be a consequence of the high
symmetry of the crystal.


We can obtain the bulk modulus $\Bulk=-VdP/dV$ and its initial
pressure derivative $\BPrime =d \Bulk/dP$ from the $PV$ data using
equation of state fitting forms.  In order to connect with preceding
work, we consider three forms. The first form is the Murnaghan
equation\cite{Murnaghan_1951}
\begin{equation}
P=\frac{\Bulk}{\BPrime}\left(\eta^{-\BPrime}-1\right)
\label{eq:Murna}
\end{equation}
where $\eta=V/V_0$.  The second form is the third-order
Birch-Murnaghan equation\cite{Poirier_1991} used previously in the
analysis of the isotherm for the high explosive
octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5-7-tetrazocine
(HMX)\cite{Yoo_1999v111,Menikoff_2001v21,Sewell_2003}
\begin{equation}
P=\frac{3}{2}\Bulk(\eta^{-7/3}-\eta^{-5/3})
     \left[1+\frac{3}{4}(\BPrime -4)(\eta^{-2/3}-1)\right].
\label{eq:BM}
\end{equation}
The third fitting form,
\begin{equation}
P=\frac{(V_0-V)c^2}{[V_0-s(V_0-V)]^2},
\label{eq:cs}
\end{equation}
was used by Olinger {\it et al.}\/ in the analysis of their isotherm
data for PETN\cite{Olinger_1975v62,Olinger_1976} and other explosives
including TATB,\cite{Olinger_1976} $\beta$-HMX and
RDX,\cite{Olinger_1978} and nitromethane.\cite{Yarger_1986v85} For
this fitting form, the initial bulk modulus and its pressure
derivative are given by $\Bulk=c^2/V_0$ and $\BPrime=4s-1$,
respectively.

Fits to isotherm data are sensitive to the fitting form chosen and the
interval of data used in the fit, particularly if the interest is in
obtaining precise predictions of the initial bulk modulus and its
pressure derivative.  To maintain consistency with the experiments of
Olinger {\it et al.}\cite{Olinger_1975v62}, we restrict our fits in
the following to pressures below 10.54~GPa. Also, in addition to
performing equation-of-state fits to our calculated isotherm, we
applied Eqs. (1)-(3) to the experimental data of Olinger {\it et al.}

Calculated and measured values for the initial bulk modulus and its
pressure derivative for PETN are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:table3}.
The results of fits in the $PV$ plane using Eqs.(1)-(3) to our
calculated isotherm are fairly consistent, with
$\Bulk=14.5$--$16.0$~GPa and $\BPrime=5.2$--$6.7$.  Applying the same
fitting forms to the experimental data of Olinger {\it et
al.}\cite{Olinger_1975v62}, we obtain $\Bulk=9.4$--$12.2$~GPa and
$\BPrime=6.4$--$11.3$.  Sorescu {\it et al.}\cite{Sorescu_1999v103}
reported $\Bulk=14.1$~GPa and $\BPrime=10.4 $ for a fit of their
rigid-molecule simulation results to the Murnaghan equation of state
(Eq.~(\ref{eq:Murna})).  Values of $\Bulk=8.8$~GPa and $\BPrime=9.9$
can be extracted from the results presented by Olinger {\it et
al.}\cite{Olinger_1976} based on the experimental isotherm.  (Note
that the latter are revised values of $\Bulk$ and $\BPrime$, and are
different from the ones initially published in
Ref. \cite{Olinger_1975v62} and subsequently used for comparison by
Sorescu {\it et al.}\/ in Ref. \cite{Sorescu_1999v103}.)  Another
experimental value for $\Bulk$ can be obtained from the isentropic
elastic tensor reported by Winey and Gupta\cite{Winey_2001v90}.
Specifically,
\begin{equation}
\Bulk=\frac{C_{33}(C_{11}+C_{12})-2C_{13}^2}{C_{11}+C_{12}+2C_{33}-4C_{13}}.
\end{equation}
This results in an isentropic bulk modulus $\Bulk^{s}=9.8$~GPa, which
can be transformed to an isothermal bulk modulus $\Bulk^t$ using the
relation $\Bulk^t/\Bulk^s=C_V/C_P$, where $C_V$ and $C_P$ are specific
heats at constant volume and constant pressure, respectively.  Using
values for $C_V$ and $C_P$ recommended in Ref.~\cite{Olinger_1976}
yields $\Bulk=9.1$~GPa.

It is unsurprising that the values of $\Bulk$ estimated from the zero
Kelvin isotherm are larger than the values obtained from
room-temperature data.  Likewise, the fact that the value of $\Bulk$
reported by Sorescu and Thompson is larger than experiment even though
it is based on a simulated room-temperature isotherm can be
tentatively attributed to the use of a rigid-molecule simulation
protocol.

%The result we obtain for the bulk modulus using Eqs. 3--4  is substantially 
%different from the others: $\Bulk=6.1$~GPa and $\BPrime=18.7$.  As has been 
%noted previously, for organic molecular cyrstals one expects significant 
%curvature in the $(U_s,U_p)$ plane for low levels of compression.  This 
%stands in contrast to metals or covalent solids, for which a linear 
%$U_s,U_p$ curve is generally expected.  This is shown in  Fig.~3, where
%we include our results (open symbols connected by dashed lines) and
%a piece-wise fit taken from Olinger {\it et al.}\cite{Olinger_1976}  From the 
%figure it is
%clear that additional calculations at lower levels of compression (smaller
%values of the abscissa) would be required to specify precisely the
%initial slope (proportional to $\BPrime$) and intercept (proportional 
%to $\Bulk^{1/2}$).  Indeed, in their final report on the PETN isotherm, Olinger
%{\it et al.}\/ used an independently measured bulk sound speed to specify the
%intercept in the $(U_s,U_p)$ plane.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
Hydrostatic compression of pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) crystal
has been studied using all-electron density-functional theory with the
PBE functional and 6-31G** basis set. Even though our all-electron
studies are considerably more demanding computationally than a
pseudopotential approach, the obvious advantage is that the results
are free from errors that might result from the pseudopotential
approximation, especially for highly compressed structures.  Optimized
molecular geometries and tetragonal lattice parameters were obtained
at eight levels of compression corresponding to pressures between zero
and 25~GPa.  Predictions of the lattice parameters and pressure as a
function of volume ratio $V/V_0$ are in good agreement with
experimental results. The results indicate essentially rigid-molecule
compression below 7~GPa, with the onset of significant intramolecular
distortions for higher pressures.  This change in behavior correlates
with the minimum in the variation of the $c/a$ ratio of lattice
parameters.

Values of the initial bulk modulus and its pressure derivative
obtained by application of three different equation of state fitting
forms to the calculated zero Kelvin isotherm are in reasonably good
agreement with values obtained by application of those same fitting
forms to the experimental data.  In both cases, the choice of fitting
form can change the predicted bulk modulus by $\approx$10--25\%.  The
average theoretical bulk modulus, which corresponds to zero Kelvins,
is 32\% larger than the corresponding average experimental value based
on the room-temperature isotherm.  The success of our all-electron
approach for PETN suggests that it may be useful to undertake
calculations of hydrostatic compression and other phenomena for other
larger and/or chemically more challenging explosives.
