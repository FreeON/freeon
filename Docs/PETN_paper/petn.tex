\begin{abstract}
All-electron calculations of the hydrostatic compression of
pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) crystal have been performed using
density functional theory with the PBE functional in
conjunction with the 6-31G** Gaussian basis set.  Full optimizations
of the atomic positions and $c/a$ ratio of lattice lengths for the 
tetragonal crystal were performed for eight compression ratios $0.65 
\le V/V_0 \le 1.00$, where $V_0$ is the equilibrium volume at zero
pressure.  The pressure as a function of compression ratio
is found to be in good agreement with experimental data.  Predictions
of the bulk modulus $K$ and its pressure derivative $K'$ were obtained
using various equation of state fitting forms. Changes in intramolecular 
coordinates were studied as a function of compression.

%Finite size scaling effect (gamma-point sampling) were assessed by calculating
%single-point energies for supercells containing up to eight unit cells (16
%molecules, 464 atoms). 
%Linear scaling with the system size and number of processors was demonstrated.

\section{Introduction}
Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN, $C(CH_2ONO_2)_4$) is a militarily 
important high explosive.  At room temperature, PETN crystallizes in a 
tetragonal space group, P4-21c,  % Hermann Mauguin Symbols
with two molecules per unit
cell\cite{Trotter_1963v16,Conant_1970}.
A high-temperature 
form denoted PETN-II has also been reported\cite{Cady_1975vB41}.  
PETN has received a lot of attention due to interesting anisotropic, 
and non-monotonic shock initiation sensitivity. {\bf Additional references}

The room temperature linear and volumetric hydrostatic compression
of PETN has been measured by Cady and co-workers\cite{Olinger_1975v62,Olinger_1976} 
using x-ray diffraction for pressures up to 10~GPa. 
Dick and von Dreele\cite{Dick_1997} used neutron scattering from deuterated
PETN to study detailed pressure-induced changes in dihedral angles and
molecular orientations in the unit cell for pressures up to 4.28~GPa. 
It is interesting to note that, while the volumetric compression reported
by Dick and von Dreele was consistent with the data of Olinger et al.,
significant differences were observed in the linear compressions along
the $a$ and $c$ axes.

A complete set of isentropic elastic coefficients for PETN were reported 
by Morris\cite{Morris_1976} on the basis
of extensive sound speed measurements on single crystals.  The resulting
elastic tensor was of high precision with the exception of element $C_{13}$,
which had an apparent uncertainty over ten times the average for the others.
Winey and Gupta\cite{Winey_2001v90} 
re-analyzed Morris' data, identified the source of the inconsistency in 
$C_{13}$, and reported an updated elastic tensor.

There have been a number of theoretical studies of PETN crystals, 
based on analytic form classical potentials.
 Dick and Ritchie\cite{Dick_1994,Ritchie_1993} performed molecular 
mechanics calculations using the AMBER4.0 force field to study the energetics 
associated with slip along specific directions in the crystal, in an effort 
to understand the anisotropic initiation sensitivity in PETN.  Their results 
were largely consistent with experimental data, but were not conclusive due 
to the lack of rate-dependent information.  

Theoretical predictions of PETN crystal structure, thermal expansion, and 
hydrostatic compression were reported by Sorescu et al.\cite{Sorescu_1999v103A,
Sorescu_1999v103}.  They used an intermolecular potential function developed 
in their laboratories in conjunction with a rigid molecule approximation for 
the molecular structure. Agreement to within one percent of the measured 
crystal lattice parameters was obtained at 300 K, although the calculated 
thermal expansion was a factor of three smaller than the experimental 
value.  Sorescu et al.  predicted linear compressibilities 
that were in reasonable agreement with experiment for pressures below 
4~GPa, with the onset of larger discrepancies for higher pressures.  (The 
calculated linear compressibilites were systematically lower than measured 
ones, resulting in a somewhat larger error in the volumetric compressibility 
over the entire pressure interval; which led to a 40\% error compared to 
experiment in the predicted initial bulk modulus.) The authors attributed 
the errors in their predictions away from ambient conditions to a shortcoming 
of the rigid-molecule approximation.

Bunte and Sun\cite{Bunte_2000v104}
reported a flexible molecule inter- and intramolecular COMPASS force field 
parameterization based on a calibration to experimental data and high level 
gas phase electronic structure results for selected nitrate esters.  
Although the force field training set did not include PETN, predicted 
crystal lattice parameters were in good agreement with experiment.  Bunte 
and Sun reported five of the six elastic coefficients for PETN at zero 
Kelvin, based on energy-minimized lattice parameters as well as experimental 
values.  Reasonable agreement with experimental data was obtained in the 
latter case, in spite of neglect of explicit thermal effects.  Since they 
did not report the $C_{13}$ elastic coefficient, it is not possible to obtain 
a bulk modulus from their work.

Zaoui and Sekkal\cite{Zaoui_2001v118} reported 
calculations of PETN thermal and mechanical properties using a flexible, 
Tersoff-like force field.  This work is difficult to interpret, as the 
primary simulation cell as described in the article corresponds to a 
non-integral number of molecules and the predicted longitudinal and 
transverse sound speeds are unrealistically small.  For these reasons, 
it will not be considered further below.

In this contribution, we report condensed phase electronic structure
calculations of the hydrostatic compression of PETN at absolute zero
and pressures up to 25 GPa, corresponding to compression ratios $V/V_0$=0.65,
where $V_0$ is the cell volume at zero pressure. {\bf Too bad we can't go 
higher, say to 50...} We employ an all-electron density-functional method 
using the PBE functional in conjunction with the 6-31G** Gaussian basis set.   
Complete optimization of the cell contents and ratio $c/a$ of the lattice 
parameters is performed at each of the eight volumes considered, assuming 
a tetragonal cell (i.e., $a=b \neq c, \alpha=\beta=\gamma=90^\circ$.
It should be noted that our all-electron treatment is considerably more
demanding computationally than pseudopotential methods, but that it should
be free from potential errors associated with pseudopotentials that would
likely become more important at high pressures.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In
Section~\ref{sec:comput} we describe the computational framework and
protocol details of our calculations. In Section~\ref{sec:results} we 
present the results of the calculations and properties derived from them,
with comparsions to experimental and preceding simulation studies. 
Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} we summarize the main conclusions
of our work.

\section{Computational Framework}
\label{sec:comput}
We have used a parallelized version of MondoSCF\cite{MondoSCF}, 
a suite of programs
for linear scaling electronic structure theory and {\it ab initio}\/
molecular dynamics, to perform the calculations.  This code employs a
number of advanced $O(N)$ techniques such as the quantum chemistry tree code
(QCTC) for the Coulomb matrix build
\cite{MChallacombe96,MChallacombe96B,MChallacombe97} and
the adaptive Hierarchical Cubature (HiCu) for the exchange-correlation 
matrix build~\cite{MChallacombe00A}. Parallelization of MondoSCF
has been carried out, where an exemplary success is 
the efficient data parallel algorithm for the
HiCu method\cite{CGan03} with equal-time partitioning scheme
which exploits the temporal locality of SCF 
calculations to achieve excellent load
balance. We have
used a cluster of 256 4-CPU HP/Compaq Alphaserver ES45s with the
Quadrics QsNet High Speed Interconnect, to perform all the calculations 
in this work. 

\section{Computational Protocol}
\label{sec:protocol}
The results described below are for pure, three-dimensionally periodic 
gradient-corrected density-functional theory (GGA), using the PBE
functional\cite{Perdew_96v77}. A variety of split-valence Gaussian
basis sets were used, although most of the calculations were performed
using the 6-31G** basis set. 

For $k$-point sampling, we primarily used the $\Gamma$ point, which is 
sufficient for the purpose in this work, as confirmed by repeating some 
calculations with a larger $1 \times 1 \times 2 $ supercell.
Thus, unless stated otherwise, all calculations were performed for a
primary simulation cell corresponding the one crystallographic
unit cell, i.e., a 1x1x1 system containing two molecules.  

Starting with the experimental x-ray crystal structure reported by
Conant et al., we calculated the zero pressure unit cell volume $V_0$ 
under the assumption of a tetragonal lattice ($a=b\neq c, 
\alpha=\beta=\gamma=90^\circ$) by computing energy-minimized structures
on a $5\times 5$ grid of $a$ and $c$ lattice parameters, 
and the results were fit
to a cubic polynomial in $a$ and $c$.  A subsequent calculation
on a $3 \times 3$ grid centered at the predicted minimum from the preceding step
was used to obtain an improved prediction of the minimum.  These
correspond to $a_0$, $c_0$, and $V_0=a_0^2c_0$.  Verification that
the resulting tetragonal structure was stable to non-tetragonal variations
in cell shape was performed by computing energy-minimized orthorhombic
structures, i.e., $a\neq c$, in the neighborhood of the tetragonal minimum; 
these tests indicated that the tetragonal structure is energetically favored 
over nearby orthorhombic ones.  {\bf should we give details about spacing 
on the grids, etc.?  I tend to think so, but sometimes get carried away
with such details...}

Energy-minimized structures for a given compression ratio $V/V_0$ 
were obtained by scanning a range of ratios $c/a$ consistent with the 
desired volume $V$.  Initial guesses were obtained by rigid translation 
of the molecular structure obtained from the next larger compression ratio 
via a transformation that preserves the center-of-mass positions in fractional 
(crystallographic) coordinates.  Typically, seven different values of
$c/a$ were considered at a given volume $V=a^2c$, and the results were
fit to a parabola.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
Calculated and measured lattice parameters are compared in Table I, where
we also include the theoretical predictions of Sorescu et al. (REF) and
Bunte and Sun (REF) for reference.  Percent errors in our calculations 
relative to the experimental results of Conant et al. are 0.50\%, 0.75\%, 
and 1.8\% for $a_0$, $c_0$, and $V_0$, respectively.  It is important to note 
that we have not attempted to correct for thermal expansion, since 
experimental coefficients of thermal expansion for PETN do not extend to 
cryogenic temperatures. 

Calculated intramolecular coordinates and selected intermolecular
distances are compared to the experimental results of Conant et al. in 
Table II.  The predicted molecular geometry is in excellent agreement
with experiment.  The 12\% discrepancy in the C-H distances is expected,
since we are comparing to x-ray data.  Otherwise, most of the intramolecular
degrees of freedom are accurately predicted to within a few percent.
{\bf comment on intermolecular distances...}

The volumetric hydrostatic compression is summarized in Fig. 1.  The 
variation of the energy with compression ratio is shown in panel a.
The solid line is a sixth-degree polynomial fit, from which the pressure
shown in panel b is obtained as $p=-dE/dV$.  The open circles in Fig 1b 
are the experimental data of Olinger et al.; experimental uncertainties
are smaller than the symbol sizes.  The calculated volumetric compression
is in remarkably good agreement with experiment.  The effects of finite 
temperature would be expected generally to ``soften'' the calculated 
isotherm at low pressures; however, the effects of this are expected to 
diminish quickly with increasing compression.

The linear compression along the $a$ and $b$ crystallographic directions
is shown in Fig. 2  We show in panel a the relative compressions $x/x_0$, 
where $x=a$ or $c$.  Calculated values are indicated by open symbols; the 
dashed line is only intended as a guide for the eye.  Crosses and stars 
denote the experimental data of Olinger et al.; as before, experimental 
uncertainties are smaller than the symbols.  In Fig. 2a we show the variation
of the $c/a$ ratio as a function of compression.  Open squares are 
calculated values; open circles were calculated from the data of Olinger
et al.; uncertainties in the experimental ratios calculated reported 
error bars are shown for representative cases.  The solid line is derived
from polynomial representations of $a=a(V)$ and $c=c(V)$ due to Olinger
et al.  Interestingly, both the calculated and experimental results indicate
an initial decrease in the $c/a$ ratio, followed by an increase that
towards a more "cubic-like" lattice structure.  The minimum in the
curves are in fairly good agreement, and correspond to a pressure of 
roughly 7.5~GPa.

We can obtain the bulk modulus $K=-VdP/dV$ and its initial pressure
derivative $K^\prime=dK/dV$ from the $P-V$ data using equation of state 
fitting forms.  In order to connect with preceding work, we consider
three four forms, namely the Murnaghan equation\cite{Murnaghan_1951}
used by Sorescu et al.,
\begin{equation}
P(V)=\frac{K}{K^\prime}\left[\left(\frac{V_0}{V}\right)^{K^\prime}-1\right];
\end{equation}
the third-order Birch-Murnaghan equation\cite{Poirier_1991} 
used previously in the analysis of the isotherm for the
high explosive 
octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5-7-tetrazocine 
(HMX)\cite{Yoo_1999v111,Menikoff_2001v21,Sewell_2003}
\begin{equation}
P(V)=\frac{3}{2}K(\eta^{-7/3}-\eta^{-5/3})
     [1+\frac{3}{4}(K^\prime -4)(\eta^{-2/3}-1)],
\end{equation}
where $\eta=V/V_0$, and a fitting form
\begin{equation}
P(V)=\frac{V_0-V}{[V_0-s(V_0-V)]^2}c^2,
\end{equation}
used by Olinger et al. in the analysis of their isothermal data for
PETN and other explosives {\bf add references...},
based on the Hugoniot jump conditions
\[ \frac{V}{V_0}=1-\frac{U_p}{U_s}, P=P_0+\rho_0U_pU_s. \].
In the latter case, the initial bulk modulus and its pressure derivative
are given by $K=\rho_0c^2$ and $K^\prime=4s-1$, respectively.  Finally,
following Olinger et al. we transformed our data into a psuedo-shock
velocity/pseudo-particle velocity plane defined by
\begin{equation}
U_p=\sqrt{(P-P_0)(V_0-V)}
U_s=V_0\sqrt{(P-P_0)/(V_0-V)},
\end{equation}
in terms of which the parameters $c$ and $s$ defined above are the
intercept and initial slope of the resulting curve in the $(U_s-U_p)$
plane.

Fits to isotherm data are quite sensitive to the fitting form chosen
and the interval of data used in the fit, particularly if the interest
is in obtainig precise predictions of the initial bulk modulus and
its initial pressure derivative.  Thus, for the sake of simplicity,
we restrict our fits in the present work to pressures of 10 GPa and
below, and do not perform a thorough sensitivity analyis of the
predicted bulk modulus to details of how the isotherm fitting is
performed.

Calculated and measured values for the bulk modulus and its initial
pressure derivative for PETN are summarized in Table III.  The results
of fits in the $P-V$ plane to our calculated isotherm are fairly 
consistent, with $K=$13.2--14.8~GPa and $K^\prime=$5.4--7.4.  Sorescu
et al. reported $K=$14.1~GPa and $K^\prime=$10.4 for a fit of their
rigid-molecule simulation data to the Murnaghan equation of state. 
Olinger et al. reported $K=$8.8~GPa and $K^\prime=$9.9 from their
analysis of the experimental isotherm {\bf ADD REF}.  (Note that these
are revised values of $K$ and $K^prime$, and are different from the 
ones initially published in Ref. {\bf XX} and used for comparison by 
Sorescu et al. in Ref. {\bf XX}.)  Another experimental value for $K$
can be obtained from the isentropic elastic tensor reported by Winey and 
Gupta {\bf ref}.  Specifically, 
\begin{equation}
K=\frac{C_{33}(C_{11}+C_{12})-2C_{13}^2}{C_{11}+C_{12}+2C_{33}-4C_{13}}.
\end{equation}
This results in an {\em isentropic} bulk modulus of $K_s$=9.8~GPa, which can 
be transformed to an {\em isothermal} bulk modulus $K_t$ using the relation 
$K_t/K_s=C_V/C_P$.  Using values for $C_V$ and $C_P$ recommended in Ref. 
{\bf XX} yields $K=$9.1~GPa. It is perhaps unsurprising that the values
of $K$ estimated from the zero Kelvin isotherm are larger than the values
obtained from room-temperature data.  Likewise, the fact that the value
of $K$ reported by Sorescu and Thompson is larger than experiment even
though it is based on a room-temperature isotherm can tentatively be
attributed to the use of rigid-molecules simulation protocol.

The value we obtain for the bulk modulus using Eq. {\bf}  is substantially 
different from the others: $K=$6.1~GPa and $K^\prime=$18.7.  As has been 
noted previously, for organic molecular cyrstals one expects significant 
curvature in the $U_s,U_p$ plane for low levels of compression.  This 
stands in contrast to metals or covalent solids, for which a linear 
$U_s,U_p$ curve is generally expected.  This is shown in Fig.~3, where
we include our results (open symbols connected by dashed lines) and
a piece-wise fit taken from Olinger et al.  From the figure it is
clear that additional calculations at lower levels of compression (smaller
values of the abscissa) would be required to specify precisely the
initial slope (proportional to $K^\prime$) and intercept (proportional 
to $K^{1/2}$) precisely requires accurate information for low levels of 
compression.  Indeed, in their final report on the PETN isotherm, Olinger
et al. used an independently measured bulk sound speed to specify the
intercept in the $U_s-U_p$ plane.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
Hydrostatic compression of pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) has
been studied with all-electron calculations with DFT/PBE in
conjunction with 6-31G** basis set. The results of pressure versus 
$V/V_0$ are in good agreement with the experimental results.

It would be interesting to compare the results of 
our all-electron calculations with that
obtained with the pseudopotential
calculations, which may not be appropriate in 
the limit of highly compressed state.

I'm going to take a break for a few days.  Note that some of
the columns in Table II get chopped off.
