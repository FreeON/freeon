This file describes the contents of this distribution of REVTeX 4.0.
The definitive source of information about REVTeX 4 is the APS web
page http://publish.aps.org/revtex4/.

**** NOTE: This is a development set, not a release, so it represents
**** work in progress. Many bugs present in the beta 1 release of REVTeX
**** have been fixed, but systematic testing has not been done. This
**** software is provided strictly for informational purposes.

**** NOTE: This is a beta release. There are bugs in this release, but
**** we believe it to be quite useable. Users of the beta package should
**** check the REVTeX 4 web site (http://publish.aps.org/revtex4/)
**** regularly for new releases and a list of known bugs. If you are
**** using this beta software beyond January 1, 2000, you shouldn't be!

Please report bugs (patches welcome!) to revtex4@aps.org. This beta
release is being made to garner feedback (both positive and negative)
and to make a fully compliant LaTeX2e version of REVTeX available (it
is long overdue).

Please note that REVTeX 4 has not yet been integrated into the APS
production process. Thus papers that are submitted in REVTeX 4 may not
qualify for the compuscript program (i.e., discounted page charges).

Installation
------------
To install REVTeX 4, put revtex4.cls, aps.rtx, rmp.rtx, revsymb.sty,
and the .bst files somewhere in your TEXINPUTS path or whereever your
TeX software looks for input files.

Credits
-------
The twocolumn mode of REVTeX 4 uses Frank Mittelbach's multicol.sty
which is distributed with LaTeX2e. The APS has licensed multicol.sty
for use in REVTeX for APS journals.

David Carlisle created the initial beta version of REVTeX 4 under
commission by the APS. Arthur Ogawa is now the developer under
contract for subsequent development, including this beta. APS is
the maintainer of REVTeX 4, and all bugs are our responsibility.
Please e-mail complaints to revtex4@aps.org.

Backwards compatibility
-----------------------
The REVTeX 4 class file has been named revtex4.cls to distinguish it
from its predecessors. If the class file is copied to revtex.cls,
files created with earlier versions of REVTeX should still work.

LaTeX2e requirements
--------------------
REVTeX 4 requires LaTeX2e [1996/06/01]

Recommended styles and packages
--------------------------
By moving to full LaTeX2e support, REVTeX users can now take advantage
of many of the well-supported style files and packages available. Here are
some that are particularly useful and recommended.

amsfonts.sty, amssymb.sty, and amsmath.sty have many useful macros and symbols,
and are recommended.

longtable.sty for long tables

hyperref.sty for hyperlinking - should work well with REVTeX 4.

graphics.sty and graphicx.sty for figure inclusion - part of LaTeX2e's
standard distribution.

bm.sty for bold math

Please see the REVTeX 4 documentation for more information.

PDF Documentation
-------
This release contains the documentation in PDF format. Creating these
PDF documents requires two packages, soon to be released on CTAN; they
are provided in this release. They are *not* needed for running REVTeX
itself.

ltxdocext.sty - Extensions to ltxdoc.cls
acrofont.sty  - Font package
