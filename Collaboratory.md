### SSL certificate

We force the [login](http://www.freeon.org/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin) and the [account creation](http://www.freeon.org/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&type=signup) page to go through SSL for security. Since we currently use a self-signed SSL certificate, your browser will likely complain that our certificate can not be trusted, but trust us, it can (we made it). You can verify that you are using the right certificate by comparing the certificat's fingerprint. It should be:

-   SHA-256 fingerprint: 44 4B 37 6E BA 1C BF A6 0E 1B 01 57 1C 82 9B 81 AB 7D 8B 5F EB CF D7 03 BD 46 6A 08 AC 70 8A 7F
-   SHA-1 fingerprint: 76 33 F9 C6 D0 67 3C 59 88 09 DF F6 7E A0 AA 04 5D 7B 4C F9
