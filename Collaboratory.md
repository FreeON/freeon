### Coding Style

-   Fortran keywords are all capital.
-   Subroutines and Functions use mixed case naming.
-   Don't be afraid of long names, something like `i`, `ii`, `iii` is not acceptable.

#### Eclipse editor settings

The [eclipse IDE](http://www.eclipse.org/) offers a powerful and convenient option for developing FreeON. Recommended plugins and settings can be found [here](Eclipse Settings "wikilink").

-   Code reuse, integrating into the existing stack
