Introduction
------------

FreeON is an experimental, open source
([GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html)) suite of programs for linear
scaling quantum chemistry. It is highly modular, and has been written from
scratch for *N*-scaling SCF theory in Fortran95 and C. Platform independent
I/O is supported with [HDF5](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/). FreeON should
compile with most modern Linux distributions and OS X. FreeON performs
Hartree-Fock, pure Density Functional, and hybrid HF/DFT calculations (e.g.
B3LYP) in a Cartesian-Gaussian LCAO basis. All algorithms are *O(N)* or ''O(N
*log* N)'' for non-metallic systems. Periodic boundary conditions in 1, 2 and
3 dimensions have been implemented through the Lorentz field (Î“-point), and an
internal coordinate geometry optimizer allows full (atom+cell) relaxation
using analytic derivatives. Effective core potentials for energies and forces
have been implemented. Advanced features include *O(N)* static and dynamic
response, as well as time reversible Born Oppenheimer Molecular Dynamics (MD).
