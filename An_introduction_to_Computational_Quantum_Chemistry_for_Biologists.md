title: An introduction to Computational Quantum Chemistry for Biologists
---

Although off-topic, it is perhaps worth mentioning that these notes were written for a course I was giving in Madrid. Due to scarceness of room availability, the course had to be condensed as much as possible, and the introduction would be reduced to a two hour lecture. We now have a devoted room for Bioinformatics training and I intend on expanding all these materials in the future as courses become longer.

Of course, if there is any error, or if someone can lend a hand, I will mostly appreciate it (and even buy you a beer or a tea if we meet in any congress, meeting or workshop).

Anyhow, expect to see this expand after its initial instance. BTW, ) already have materials for the full TOC, in Spanish. They will show up as I finish the translation. --[Jrvalverde](User:Jrvalverde "wikilink") ([talk](User talk:Jrvalverde "wikilink")) 10:35, 27 May 2012 (MDT)
