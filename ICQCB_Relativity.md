Relativistic effects
--------------------

When we defined the elements that we were to include in the electron wave function, we ignored all relativistic effects. As a general rule, they are small enough to be neglected, and in most circumstances we are not interested the very least in them. But there are situations where they are relevant.

Basically: electrons accumulate around the nucleus. All of them have the same charge, so they repel each other. Electrons in the inner shells repel outwards external electrons, and external electrons push inner electrons towards the nucleus. As the number of electrons increases, the pressure the external electrons exert over inner electrons drives increases driving them closer and closer to the nucleus, contracting their orbitals. As the distance to the nucleus reduces, the kinetic energy of the electron increases, and, if it is small enough, will result in speeds that get close to the speed of light, making then relevant the relativistic effects.

In general, for the atoms we normally use in Biochemistry, this is not a problem, since any relativistic effect of the kinetic energy of internal electrons is irrelevant. But as we advance in the periodic table towads heavier elements, these effects start to aquire relevance, specially when we reach transition metals like Chromium (Cr), Iron (Fe), Zinc (Zn), etc...

The presence of these metallic elements is scarce in living organisms (traces), but when they are present, they have a major role of utmost importance (as in haemoglobin). To deal correctly with metalloproteins we should consider these effects.

To include relativistic effects, we use methods derived from Dirac's equations, but we are not going to get into more detail. It is enough noting that the majority of the methods we will see next do not usually account for relativistic effects.

Summarizing what we have to date: Usefulness of QM relies on two basic factors:

-   The quality of the initial approximations to atomic orbitals
-   The quality of the calculation method

Generally, we will ignore relativistic effects (which is enough for the vast majority of problems we deal with), but sometimes, it will be worth considering them.

At the very bottom, all we are interested in, is learning how we can play with these two factors to carry out our calculations and how our choice will affect their quality.
