**************************************************
This is an alpha release of MondoSCF.  It is far 
from perfect.  Please send your bug reports and 
suggestions for improvements to MChalla@LANL.Gov 
with the subject "MONDO_BUGS".  

Find an example .cshrc file in MONDO/Scripts/CSHRC
Find example inputs in MONDO/Validate
Find compiler flags in MONDO/Includes/CompilerSpecifics.X.Y

To make MondoSCF, set up your .cshrc.  Edit your
CompilerSpecifics file.  Go the the main directory
and type "make all".  To invoke MondoSCF, you type
"m x.inp", or "m x.inp y.out", or "m x.inp y.out z.log"

Short cuts for making and changing to different 
directories may be found in MONDO/Scripts/MondoSetUp 
and in the main Makefile.  You do not have the main
MondoSCF source.  You have reprocessed little postfix
files, eg *.f90 *.f *.c.  Be careful not to issue 
purge commands with these files, as purge will delete
your source.  This goes also for "make backup"

KNOWN PROBLEMS:

o No documentation.

o The F90 ONX code for exact exchange is not stable.
  Currently, matrix builds only work under Intel or 
  AMD Linux. Matrix builds may be slow and forces 
  incorrect.  

o Periodic boundary conditions with small exponent
  ~1.D-2 basis sets may result in instabilities.
  Periodics do not work yet with exact exchange.

o Clean up of scratch files less than perfect.
  Want to "mk pScr" after big runs to clean scratch.
