These basis sets were obtained in Gaussian 94 format
from the EMSL Gaussian Basis Set Order Form at
http://www.emsl.pnl.gov:2080/forms/basisform.html.
To add a basis set, copy it here, strip off extraneous
ascii, modify Modules/BasisSetParameters.F90 as
appropriate and remake. 

Alternatively, you can create your own basis sets (mix and match or whatever)
and copy/link them to User1.bas or User2.bas;  then just specify User1 or User2 
in your input files.

Finally, users should consider the following:

Basis sets were obtained from the Extensible Computational Chemistry Environment Basis Set Database, 
Version 6/19/03, as developed and distributed by the Molecular Science Computing Facility, Environmental 
and Molecular Sciences Laboratory which is part of the Pacific Northwest Laboratory, P.O. Box 999, Richland,
