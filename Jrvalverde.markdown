Better known since the dawn of time as **JR**, **José** or simply **j**, José R. Valverde has PhD in Medicine and Surgery by [Universidad Autónoma de Madrid](http://www.uam.es), works as head of Scientific Computing Services in the [National Biotechnology Center](http://www.cnb.csic.es), [Spanish Research Council](http://www.csic.es) (CNB/CSIC) and is a member of the [Higher Body of Systems and Information Technology of the State Administration](http://www.astic.es) in Spain, EU.

José has been working on Bioinformatics and Biocomputing since he started his licensure thesis (1984) on Molecular Biology of Aging. He got his PhD sequencing the mitochondrial genome of *Artemia franciscana* at the Department of Biochemistry of University Autonoma and the Institute of Enzymology of the Spanish Research Council, which was to become the [Biomedical Research Institute](http://www.iib.csic.es). At the time, he also was involved in the first national program for in vitro fertilization with embryo transfer for humans at Hospital La Paz, Madrid, Forensic Medicine, Developmental Biology, and Exobiology working for the [European Space Agency, ESA](http://www.esa.int).

Formally speaking, J. R, Valverde worked as Manager of Bioinformatics services at the Biomedical Research Institute in Spain (1991), then moved to the [European Bioinformatics Insitute (EBI)](http://www.ebi.ac.uk) in Hinxton, UK, for its foundation (1994) and returned to Spain to work at the National Biotechnology Center.

José has working in most areas of Bioinformatics and Biocomputing, leading the first Grid-computing developers group in Spain participating in EGEE, and becoming involved in many international coordination initiatives, like [EMBnet](http://www.embnet.org) (where he served in the Executive Board), the Iberoamerican Bioinformatics Network which led to [SOIBIO](http://www.soibio.org) the Iberoamerican Bioinformatics Society (of which he's a Founding Member), and most recently [FreeBIT](http://www.freebit.org), the Iberoamerican Network for Free Software in the Life and Health Sciences (which he coordinates). His current research interests are spread mainly between Meta- and Phylo-genomics, and Molecular Simulations using Computational Chemistry.
