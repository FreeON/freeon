# This is an example reference file.

# Comments are everything after a '#' character anywhere in the line. The syntax
# of a test is simply
#
# tag = value (error)
#
# The tag is a regular expression and has to be enclosed in double quotations.
# The regular expression has to be include exactly one group, i.e. stuff inside
# a pair of (), which tells the script how to find the value to be matched.
#
# For example, the following:
#
# "^Rho_tot = (.*)" = 1 (1e-10)
#
# will search for the occurence of the string Rho_tot at the beginning of the
# line and the value after an '=' character. The value expected is "1" with an
# error of 1e-10.

"^Rho_tot = (.*)" = 1 (1e-10)
