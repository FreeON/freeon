 PROGRAM OF CALCULATIONS:

  A restricted Roothaan-Hall solution of the SCF using
  a loose accuracy level, STO-2G and the PW91x/PW91c model.
 

  Followed by a  restricted Roothaan-Hall solution of the SCF using
  a good accuracy level,STO-3G and the B88x/LYPc model.
 

  Followed by a  restricted Roothaan-Hall solution of the SCF using
  a tight accuracy level,STO-6G and the PBEx/PBEc model.
