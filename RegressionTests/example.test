# This is an example test input script file. Comments are everything after a '#'
# character. The following variables are known to the script:

# The input file that is passed to Mondo.
input = something.inp

# The MondoSCF executable to use.
Mondo_executable = /usr/local/Mondo/bin/MondoSCF

# In case the regression test built Mondo first and we want to run this test
# with this executable, we need to tell the regression test to set the
# Mondo_executable variable itself.
Mondo_tar = ../mondoscf-alpha-latest.tar.bz2
