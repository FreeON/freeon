This is by no means any exhaustive list of Computational Quantum Chemistry applications, but only a brief introduction to some characteristic calculations that are commonly performed.

### Electronic Structure

Obviously, the first application is the fine resolution of molecular structure. To achieve this we try to adjust the geometry until we obtain the lowest energy level. This is, in itself, interesting enough, but has a problem: for the most important biological molecules (macromolecules) we need to carry out very large computations that are unfeasible using traditional methods. We need to resort to modern, linear scaling methods to deal with these structures.

In any case, the calculations we can easily perform, are very useful: on one hand we can analyze in great detail substrates, drugs and smaller molecules, and on the other hand, even if modeling a full macromolecule is hard, we can model a relevant part of it, such as a protein's active site.

When we resolve the electronic structure, we nor only find the best geometry, but also the electronic charge distribution, which allows us to determine dipole, quadrupole, etc.. moments, and specially, the charge distribution in specific molecular orbitals. This is more interesting as it allows us to identify the reactive areas of molecules: the 'HOMO' (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) is the outermost occupied orbital, the one that contains reactive electrons in electron donor molecules, while the 'LUMO' (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) identifies the first orbital with free space to accommodate an electron in electronic acceptor molecules.

There are visualization programs that can show not only the optimized geometry, but also the HOMO and LUMO distributions, enabling us to predict the reactive regions in a molecule........
