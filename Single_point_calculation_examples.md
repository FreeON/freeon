Single Point calculations
-------------------------

In subdirectory **SinglePoint**, under the **Validate** directory of FreeON source code distribution (./Validate/SinglePoint/.) you can find examples of various kinds of single point energy calculations.

A single point calculation solves the SCF equations to calculate the wavefunction of the system which can be used to derive a number of useful properties, most prominently, the energy of the system. It uses the geometry provided, without any initial geometry optimization.

The actual method used to solve the Schr√∂edinger equations will depend on the characteristics of the system.
