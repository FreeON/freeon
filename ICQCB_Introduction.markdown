Introduction
------------

**Welcome** to a exciting new world. We are going to visit together the basic principles of Quantum Mechanics and their application in Chemistry. At the end of this tour, you should be able to carry out and interpret a modeling process using Quantum Mechanics.

Let us start dispelling the major fears: normally, we will not need to perform ourselves any calculation or encode any algorithm: **there are many programs** or program packages that cover practically all the standard analysis (and even some experimental approaches), and it is these programs that we will use. However, in order to decide the program or method that we should use, we need some minimal previous knowledge of basic concepts. We are going to review (or rather give an overview) of these basic concepts here. In the process we will see a few formulas, but you shouldn't worry about them: you do not need to remember them in detail, it is enough if you remember their practical implications.

Quantum Mechanics is one of those disciplines we have all learnt to fear and consider as one of the most esoteric fields in Science. If there is anything most people consider "dark magic" in Science, this is it. Nevertheless, and as we shall see, this is far from the truth. As soon as we scratch a little, teeny, weeny, bit the surface, we will discover that it is far easier than it looks.

The problem with Quantum Mechanics is not its conceptual complexity, but its practical application: the amount of functions to evaluate and integrate grows very quickly forcing us to use ingenious tricks and various approximations to speed up computation.

But you should not worry about that complexity either. Not in principle at least: all we will do usually is specify the method to use to a program which is very easy to use. It is only that, depending on the sacrifices we are willing to accept, we will be able to approach smaller or bigger problems more or less efficiently. And to make a decision we need to understand the main methods available.

In the accompanying sections we will see why is it so important, and how do we use Quantum Mechanics.
