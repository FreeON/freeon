MC Change log 11/27/00

o MondoMods
  - BraKetBloks: getprimative has been renamed SetBraBlok, and an option for 
    including a phase factor has been added.
  - DerivedTypes: The PrimPair type has Ket as the accumulatory vector
    instead of Bra.  Bra is HGBra from BraKetBlocks.
  - Functionals: has been redone.  Includes Slater-Dirac which is
    alpha=1 and rhototal^(4/3) and XAlpha which is alpha=2/3 and
    rhoalpha^(4/3)+rhobeta^(4/3).  All functionals except PBE and PBE0
    have been validated against G98 and Q-Chem.  Functionals now include
    source from MMA/Functionals, generated by the completely redone 
    MMA source Functionals.nb.  An important point here is that the 
    factor of 2 multiplying dEdAbsGradRho2 in HiCu/KxcGen has been subsumed
    into the functionals, as have misc factors of 2 and 4 from Functionals.F90.
  - GlobalScalars: constants ThreeHalf etc have been changed to ThreeHalves
    etc to be gramtically correct.  These changes have been propigated 
    throughout.
  - Indexing: IBloDex has been renamed CFBlokDex
  - Macros: Getting and setting thresholds has now been replaced by a call to
    SetThresholds(CurBase).
  - Makefile:  mk mma makes the entire MondoMods, while mk mm makes all but
    the DGEMMs and small matrix benchmarks.
  - MatFunk:  Fixed a serious bug (Missing ABS()) for thresholding small
    eigenvalues.
  - Parse: Added the new function DblToMMAChar() which will return a string
    suitable for printing a MMA formated character.  Fixed DblToShrtChar()
    so that it can return a negative value.
  - PrettyPrint:  Added MMA support to Print_HGRHO.  Added the optional argument
    Misc_O to ProcessName(Proc,Misc_O)  which lets additional info be added.
  - SMWrap.c: removed double underscore routines.
  - Thresholds: Added SetThresholds(CurBase) which gets and sets intermediate
    thresholds.
  - MondoMods/MMA/Functionals/PBEx.Inc etc. These are include files used 
    by Functionals.  
  - MondoMods/MMA/Functionals/Functionals.nb.  This is the 99% ready for openshell
    notebook that generates functional source.  Note that compiling with
    PGF90 v3.1 and -O2 breaks some of this code. Therefore, use only  
    -O1 untill we try v3.2 (which still has bugs).
o SCFeqs
  - DIIS: Works now.  Fixed several bigbugs,included an uninitialized variable.
    OOed the inverse matrix to MatFunk.  Avoid thresholding the error matrices,
    since these will go to zero much to fast otherwise.  May want to threshold 
    eventually with a tighter value....
  - FBuild: Fixed bug that added in whole K matrix for B3LYP.  B3LYP works fine now.
  - RHeqs: Removed DSYEVD source.  Fixed bug in computing HOMO-LUMO gap.
  - SCFStatus:  Reformated stdoutput.
  - SDMM: SDMM now has an automatic criterion for swithcing from CG to purification.
    Numerous minor improvments. Still needs some tuning.
  - ToDev: New routine added which writes MMA formatted matrices to MMA/SCFDev
    for development of DMM methods.  Only made if requested, eg "make Dev"
  - /MMA/SCFDev/dev.m: Development code that mirrors changes to SDMM.
o ONX
  - MakeTables/Makefile: Added EXTRA_INCLUDES to specify MondoMods/MMA/Functions
  - PONX/ONXLoop:  Added "USE SpecFun" and changed "TE=ErrorFC(T)" to "TE=ERFC(T)",
    where ERFC is defined in SpecFun.
  - PONX/Makefile: Removed $(LAPACK)
o QCTC
  - JBlok: Fixed the now famous "phase" bug.  Eliminated the double counting of ExpAB
    by changing Tol=TwoENeglect/MAX(1.D-32,ExpAB*BraEstimate) to 
                Tol     = TwoENeglect/MAX(1.D-32,BraEstimate).
    Added a missing Sqrt to the Bra integral estimates.
  - MakeDJ:  Added new call to NewBraKetBlok(BS) which allocates HGBra.
    removed underscores in PChkSum and PPrint which broke the MMA formating.
o OneE
  - RhoBlok: Switched ThreshPrim to the now standard TestPrimPair.
    Propigated misc changes through from MondoMods.
  - SBlok:  Added TestPrimPair.
o HiCu
  - CubeTree:  Added optional argument Exp_Switch to SetPenetrationThresh.
    Changed IF(Cube%Box%Tier<2)THEN to IF(Cube%Box%Tier<10)THEN.  I think this
    fixes the near infinite recursion that occurs for high-symmetry systems.
    Added an ABS as in ABS(RhoV(J+1,I))) when determining ISplit.  
  - HiCu:  Added call to NewBraKetBlok to initialize braketbloks.
  - Makefile:  Added option -DEXPLICIT_SOURCE which togles on the explicit
    fortran source gerated by VRhoMD.F90.  Also added EXTRA_INCLUDES.
  - RhoTree:  Added general source back in, and made optional.  General source
    for computing populations may still be broken.
  - KxcGen: Switched sign of grid-center vectors and removed phase factor.
    Added HGRho and SetBraBlok.  Computes only upper triagle of Kxc now.
    Added general code.  In gernal code, factor of two has moved to 
    MondoMods/MMA/Functionals/Functionals.nb.
  - VRhoMD: Switched sign of grid-center vectors and removed factor of two from
    explicitbraelements.
o XForm
  - BlokAInv:  Switched Z and Zt in output.  
o Includes
  - Suffixes:  Added $(EXTRA_INCLUDES) to compiler line.  This is where non-standard
    includes to say MondoMods/MMA/Functions should og.
  - CompilerSpecifics.IntelLinux.X have been updated.  In particular, now
    works for LAHEY, NAG, and PG.  PG optimizations have been depricated to -O1
    for now, as -O2 breaks certain functionals.  ABSOFT compiles but is broken
    in many places (compilers fault I'm 99% sure). 
o MondoSCF
  - ChkSCFs:  Convergence checking has been improved somewhat.  Still needs
    more work. 
  - Overlay:  Added code to mark ProgramFailed=.TRUE. before invokation.
  - ParseInput: Moved parsing for guess in to parsebasissets.  Guess=Core works now.
    Fixed uninitialized basis set name bug.
  - SetSCFs:  Commented out BKEst call and associated IO.
  - SCFLocals:  Still fidling with thresholds ...
!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MC Change log 11/1/00:
o The BlokAInv code is now working (very well!) in F90, allowing 
  sparse linear algebra for O(N) calculations.

o Much legacy code has been trimmed from the source tree.  Backup
  tarballs take up much less space.

o I've added the PHiPAC directory for optimizing small matrix DGEMMs
  An environmental variable is set at login which picks an 
  optimized set of DGEMMs for your machine.  This speeds up the 
  linear algebra quite a bit.   Only works for LINUX at this point.

o You will want to redo some of your .cshrc file.  See the example
  in Scripts/CSHRC

o The makefiles have been redone.  See the main makefile and
  the MONDO/Scripts/MondoSetUp file for short cuts.  For example,
  you can now make just a few directories at a time using the
  same "abreviations" you used for going places:

  $ mk mm q 

  makes both MondoMods and QCTC, in that order.

  $ mk cmm cq

  will clean those directories, but will not remove the associated libraries.

  $ mk pmm pq 

  will purge those directories, removing the libraries and any .Inc files that
  can be recomputed from other code, as for example VRhoMD.F90 in HiCu.
  This is really a usefull and powerfull utility that will save you lots of time.

o I've added a Thresholding module in MondoMods.  This should now be a unified
  place to collect all methods related to thresholding atom pairs, primitive pairs,
  evaluation of density outside a box (penetration criteria),  exact exchange thresholding,
  etc, etc.  Please consolidate your thresholds in here!

o Any Mathematica files should now go in an appropriate subdirectory called MMA
  in the relavent directory.  For example, the notebook that generates special functions
  is now in MONDO/MondoMods/MMA/Functions.
