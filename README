        TO DO LIST FOR MondoSCF DEVELOPERS 

    >> Release of Version 1.0 beta 1 this November << 

Items marked with an x need to be in place before the release!

Chee Kwan:
$ Get parallel code working as is to level of OneE
$ Help redo front end to work with MPI-2 and MPI_COMM_SPAWN
  as well as with old style serial spawning of mpirun
o Check out load balance for large OneE jobs, start to think
  about domain decomposition.  Examine performance for OneE
  with and without PBCs.
o Make sure MPI2 code works on SGIs, LINUX/LAM-MPI, IBM SP2, HP/Compaq?
o Preliminary work on ordering algothim for load balancing
  and locality: demonstrate scaling of OneE routines in 
  both limits of Natoms/Nproc->0,Infinity

Karoly:
o Gradients only transition state theory
o SCRF,Crystal field,QM/MM for boundary conditions
o Applications to Protein Kinase and ?
o Internal coordinates geometry optimization
o Accelerated MD/Parallel Tempering

Matt:
$ Finish validation suite and checking accuracies
$ Get front end and output formatting cleaned
  >> hostname, machtype, processor info etc to outfile <<
$ Add example CSHRCs to Scripts file
$ Get QuNew geometry optimization working again
$ Make sure density matrix extrapolation is working
x Documentation
o Get working under AIX.XLF, True64.COMPAQ, SUN? HP? 
o Help with parallization
$ Interface with OpenDX for isosurfacing and movies

CJ:
x PBC validation suite!
x PBC Benchmark suite and scaling runs for HiCu, QCTC and SDMM
o Write up PBC
o Write up new MAC and PAC
o Help periodifiy ONX
? Coordinate transformations for HiCu
? On the fly PAO basis set contractions in the 
  molecular environs

Eric:  
x Get ONX working on SGIs and Alphas
x Release enable makefiles 
x Gradients
x Explicit code
