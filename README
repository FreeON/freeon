Things in MondoSCF have changed.  Following is a partial list of what happened:

o Almost all legacy F77 code has been removed

o The BlokAInv code is now working (very well!) in F90, allowing 
  sparse linear algebra for O(N) calculations.

o Much legacy code has been trimmed from the source tree.  Backup
  tarballs take up much less space.

o I've added the PHiPAC directory for optimizing small matrix DGEMMs
  An environmental variable is set at login which picks an 
  optimized set of DGEMMs for your machine.  This speeds up the 
  linear algebra quite a bit.   Only works for LINUX at this point.

o You will want to redo some of your .cshrc file.  See the example
  in Scripts/CSHRC

o The makefiles have been redone.  See the main makefile and
  the MONDO/Scripts/MondoSetUp file for short cuts.  For example,
  you can now make just a few directories at a time using the
  same "abreviations" you used for going places:

  $ mk mm q 

  makes both MondoMods and QCTC, in that order.

  $ mk cmm cq

  will clean those directories, but will not remove the associated libraries.

  $ mk pmm pq 

  will purge those directories, removing the libraries and any .Inc files that
  can be recomputed from other code, as for example VRhoMD.F90 in HiCu.
  This is really a usefull and powerfull utility that will save you lots of time.

o I've added a Thresholding module in MondoMods.  This should now be a unified
  place to collect all methods related to thresholding atom pairs, primitive pairs,
  evaluation of density outside a box (penetration criteria),  exact exchange thresholding,
  etc, etc.  Please consolidate your thresholds in here!

o Any Mathematica files should now go in an appropriate subdirectory called MMA
  in the relavent directory.  For example, the notebook that generates special functions
  is now in MONDO/MondoMods/MMA/Functions.  

============================================================================================
We need to get this code clean, working and validated soon.  Following are todo lists for
developers.  Please feel free to add to my todo list, and to update this file
in the CVS tree thereafter.  Also, as you accomplish your goals, please remove them from your 
todo list and update this file in the CVS tree. 

Matt:
o Fix triangular degeneracies w/PBCs in HiCu/KxcGen etc
o Write up new BlokAInv w/Michele and Mirek
o Get SDMM to work for hard problems (eg. pure DFT)
o Make sure parallel LinAlg still works
o Rewrite QCTC with k-d trees
o Profile/tune PBC and Gradients code
o Talk for NC Nano-Bio
o Validate code with G98 and Crystal98
o Create a benchmark directory with validation scripts
o Get working under IntelLinux.ABSOFT, AIX.XLF, True64.COMPAQ
o Parallelization 
o Documentation
o Interface with OpenDX for isosurfacing and movies

CJ:
o Get pure DFT PBC working and validated
o PBC scaling runs for HiCu, LinAlg and short write up
o QCTC
o Write up linear scaling and PBC
o Talk for ACS 2001
o Code for multipole tensors with arb PBCs
o New density matrix guesser/minimizers

Eric:  
o Get ONX working again
o F90ify and consolidate flavors of ONX, Gammas, etc
o Gradients of exact K
o Periodics of exact K
o Parallel exact K
o Talk for ACS 2001

Mike:
