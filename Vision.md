**Free *O*(*N*): Transparency and Freedom**

![](OTDRoadmapFinal.png "fig:OTDRoadmapFinal.png") Transparency promotes scrutiny by many eyes, concentrating and amortizing development, validation and verification efforts. The credibility of *O*(*N*) methods lie at the margin, at the trade off between speed and precision -- only with an open and transparent code base can this trade off be established.

![](SBES-allpresentations-30Apr08.png "fig:SBES-allpresentations-30Apr08.png") OpenSource isn't just about no-cost, its about the freedom to innovate, collaborate and build a scientific commons. It means technological agility, and a pace of innovation that can only be achieved by distributed collaborative development.

**Free *O*(*N*): Economy and Democretization**

![](Gpu.jpg "fig:Gpu.jpg") Reduced complexity algorithms can provide far more economical increases in simulation capability relative to simple parallelization of conventional algorithms. Together with ongoing increases in desktop power, *O*(*N*) algorithms may provide capabilities to the individual that were only recently the exclusive domain of national supercomputer centers.

**Free *O*(*N*): A Unified Approach to fast Quantum Chemistry**

The litterature reveals a suprising commonality between reduced complexity methods across diverse problem domains. From data base theory to electronic structure, algorithms are emerging for problems like fast lookups, set intersection, machine learning, Coulomb summation and matrix multiplication with similar, "best of" data structures and programming models that are *N*-body like; so called Generalized *N*-Body Solvers. FreeON is being redeveloped with a unified *N*-body approach at all levels, based on recently developed methods for the multiplication of matrices with decay [1](http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.3534), [2](http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.3534).

**Free *O*(*N*): HPC**

*N*-body methods involve irregular data access, which impacts HPC implementations from prefetch to the interconnect. A forefront area of research involves parallel irregular methods for Generalized *N*-Body Solvers that parley quantum locality into data locality.
