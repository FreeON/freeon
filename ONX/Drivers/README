These are the driver files for the "general" version of the VRR code and the 
"general" version of the contraction step. 

The structure of VRRLoc is:

Line  Desc.
----------------
 1    LngDrv
 2    LngLoc
 3    is = location in the VRRDriver where the memory locations are that tell where
           to put the intrgrals generated in the RGen step into the temp. integral
           space.
 4    nr = The number of integrals from the RGen step to transfer
 5    ns = The number of VRR steps that we need to do, the first VRR step starts at 
           location in+nr in the VRRDriver file.
 6    is
 7    nr  (continues on for each integral class)
 8    ns
  ...
 
The correct set of is,nr, and ns in the VRRLoc file to use is determined by 

  id = lbra+1+lket*(lmax+1)

Note: The above description is for the ascii version of the driver file. The 
binary version that is created by the code is *different*. See the code for the 
exact format. 


The structure of CDriver is:

I will add this description later. For now, just take a look at the contraction 
part of the code to see the format.
