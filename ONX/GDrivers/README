These files contain the indexing that is used to drive the
exchange gradient code.

--------------------------------------------------
G1:
Used by ContractG.F90
The first five lines contain the following vairables: L1, LenDa,
LenDc, LenDb, LenDn. The remaining L1/4 lines contain the
variables: iC, iP, iQ, and iU for each contraction step. L1 is i
the total number of contraction steps for this integral class.
Besides being contracted, the integrals need to be scaled by
2*Za, 2*Zc, 2*Zb, and 1. In ContractG.F90, LenDa, LenDc, ect.
are used tell where the indexes for the different scale factors
start and stop in the main driver list.

The other variables are used to control the contraction steps as (I
removed some of the indexes below for clarity):

  C(iC) = U(iU) * CB(iP) * CK(iQ)

Note that we never scale by 2*Zd because we are going to use
translational invariance to evaluate derivatives WRT center d
(see Eqn. 21 in JCP 89, 5777 (1988).

--------------------------------------------------
G2:
Used by ComputeXForce.F90 to drive the calls to HrrKet.F90
The first line, NT, is the number of HRR sets we need to do.
The remaining NT lines contain: N1, N2, N3, and N4. N2 is just
a dummy variable for the HrrKet routine, it is only included to
make it look the same as the HrrBra driver files (G3). N1 is the
total number of untransformed integral locations on the Bra side
of the integral. NT is the integral type for the Ket side of the
integral. N3 is used to figure out where each of the integral classes
that we are computing are located in the W1 integral buffer space.

The set of HRR calls that we are making here correspond to 
something like the top half of Table II. in JCP 89, 5777 (1988).

--------------------------------------------------
G3:
Used by ComputeXForce.F90 to drive calls to HrrBra.F90
This is very similar to the format of G2. The only real difference
is that not N2 contains the number of transformed integrals on
the Ket side that we need to loop over.

--------------------------------------------------
G4:
Used by GetGradient.F90
The first line LG4 is the number of integrals we need to loop over
to compute the gradient. The remaining LG4 lines contain the indexes
I1, I2, I3, and I4 that are used to compute the sum:

  SW(I1) = W(I2) - I4 * W(I3)

This corresponds to Eqn. 20 in J. Chem. Phys. 89, 5777 (1988)


--------------------------------------------------
G5:
These files were used in the original version of GSONX to compute
the gradient with multipole expansions. This part is so badly broken
that we should probably just ignore this for now. These files were
generated (very painfully) by hand. The general format is described
in some (handwritten) notes I have in my file cabinet.
