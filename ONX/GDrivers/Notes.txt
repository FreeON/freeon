1. In the G2.* files I need to add the size of the ket space in the 
3rd column. This should be the same as the second column in G3.*

2. In ComputeXForce, I call HrrKet with N1,N1 this should lead to extra 
looping that is not needed. Eventually, the correct looping lengths should 
be included.

3. Need to add a fith column to G2 and G3 files. This will correspond to 
the final length of the bra (in G2, not really used) and the ket (in G3).
