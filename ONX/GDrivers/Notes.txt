1. In the G2.* files I need to add the size of the ket space in the 
3rd column. This should be the same as the second column in G3.*

           - Done

2. In ComputeXForce, I call HrrKet with N1,N1 this should lead to extra 
looping that is not needed. Eventually, the correct looping lengths should 
be included.

3. Need to add a fith column to G2 and G3 files. In the G2 files this is 
just a place holder so they call all be set to zero. In G3 this should be
the final size of the bra integral class that is being computed.  

           - Done
