1. In the G2.* files I need to add the size of the ket space in the 
3rd column. This should be the same as the second column in G3.*

           - Done

2. In ComputeXForce, I call HrrKet with N1,N1 this should lead to extra 
looping that is not needed. Eventually, the correct looping lengths should 
be included.

3. Need to add a fith column to G2 and G3 files. In the G2 files this is 
just a place holder so they call all be set to zero. In G3 this should be
the final size of the bra integral class that is being computed.  

           - Done


4. Item #1 above appears to be all messed up. Did I make a mistake here???

           - No, these are fine.
           - Done

5. The G4 files now need to be made consistent with the rest of the
addressing. 

          - Not true
          - Done

6. It's the G1 files that are messed up, they need to be regenerated with 
the correct amount of space that comes out of the VRR space. This means that 
the locations in the G2 and G3 files will need to be updated. Plus the values
of NVRRg in GetIntSpace are wrong.
