1. There is a problem with the array sizes in GetIntSpace.F90.
The SpaceV array appears to be messed up in at least the SpaceV(9) 
possition. This is used in ContractG.F90 for the 4th array index of 
the uncontracted integrals. 

The problem here is actually being caused by the GDriver data files 
being out of sync with the rest of the integral code. This should be 
an easy fix. The DriverMaker.F program in /ONX/GDrivers should be set
up to regenerate all of the data files correctly. It is just going 
to take some cut-and-paste work. 

         Done


2. I am getting Nans from the Dab subblock when the gradient is 
digested... For some reason the subblock is not being loaded 
correctly.
