1. change the onx int looping structure so that for a given 
batch of integrals ACx ACy ACz is held constant. This is the 
last step needed to make hrrbra and hrrket the same in sonx 
and onx.    DONE


2. fix the vrr c code, it does not correctly determine the 
length of the buffers that it is supposed to read in from 
disk. Just a simple syntax fix.   DONE


3. In the process of testing DisOrder. So far s-type ints have 
been checked and seem to work.   DONE

4. >s functions do not work. it looks like vrrl is going out 
of bounds somewhere and messing things up when you try and 
deallocate memory at the end of DisOrder.  

  the problem is in vrrdriver. the file sizes are messed up!

   DONE

5. Changed the distribution code in hrrket and hrrbra to match 
the sonx style. This is a better way to do it because you can 
use standard math operations to find out which one should be raised
in vrr.  DONE


6. Need to add the buffers BufT and SchT to DisOrder. DONE

7. Need to add the code to stuff the distribution info into the buffers.
