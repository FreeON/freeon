1. change the onx int looping structure so that for a given 
batch of integrals ACx ACy ACz is held constant. This is the 
last step needed to make hrrbra and hrrket the same in sonx 
and onx.    DONE


2. fix the vrr c code, it does not correctly determine the 
length of the buffers that it is supposed to read in from 
disk. Just a simple syntax fix.   DONE


3. In the process of testing DisOrder. So far s-type ints have 
been checked and seem to work.   DONE

4. >s functions do not work. it looks like vrrl is going out 
of bounds somewhere and messing things up when you try and 
deallocate memory at the end of DisOrder.  

  the problem is in vrrdriver. the file sizes are messed up!

   DONE

5. Changed the distribution code in hrrket and hrrbra to match 
the sonx style. This is a better way to do it because you can 
use standard math operations to find out which one should be raised
in vrr.  DONE


6. Need to add the buffers BufT and SchT to DisOrder. DONE

7. Need to add the code to stuff the distribution info into the buffers.

      DONE

8. The DisPtr arrays are all messed up. ONX and SONX do this in 
very different ways... I think this version needs to be more like
onx here...   

      DONE (For now), DONE

9. In PutDis the I0 addresses to DisBuf and PrmBuf are messed up. I need
to add in the iDis and iPtr offsets...

      DONE

10. Need to put the schwartz ineq. into a vector for skipout. 
Move BufN,BufT, and SchT out of DB and add the real buffers into 
DB. This is getting very messy...

      DONE

11. Need to F90'fy GetAdr.F and PutSubBlk.F.

      DONE

12. Need to address memory issues with IB%MaxInts, as it is now, the 
buffers could overflow...  
    
     DONE

13. Everything seems to be in place, time to check some K matrices.
     Works for s-type integrals, p-type is messed up. 

    DONE

14. Still a small bug in the d-type integral code. The PONX code works 
fine, so should be easy to find bug.
 
     DONE

15. In the process of changinf the indexing in IB%WR and IB%WZ. Still need to 
modify DisOrder, RGen1C, ect... then test it out.
