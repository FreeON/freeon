1. change the onx int looping structure so that for a given 
batch of integrals ACx ACy ACz is held constant. This is the 
last step needed to make hrrbra and hrrket the same in sonx 
and onx. 


2. fix the vrr c code, it does not correctly determine the 
length of the buffers that it is supposed to read in from 
disk. Just a simple syntax fix.
