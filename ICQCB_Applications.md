==Or, why should I learn about all this?==

Quantum Mechanics requires a large amount of computing power and storage space, and therefore, as the problem size grows, we are forced to make bigger simplifications in order to be able to keep the problem technologically tractable.

That is true, but so it is that every day we have bigger computers, and problems that were once untractable have now fallen under our grip. That is the case of QM in the Life and Health Sciences: by the end of the XX Century, there was not much to chose from, we could, at most, use semiempirical models (more on them later) to make limited simulations of reaction processes. Nowadays, we have a wider choice of tools, and thanks to them, we can increase the precision and size of the problems we want to study.

Basically, we use QM to model with accuracy and precision the structure and properties of small and middle size molecules. More recently, it has become feasible to approach even bigger problems, and now we can even treat macromolecules (like a full protein) using modern technologies.

A big advantage of QM modeling is that we deal explicitly with electrons. Let us not forget that a molecule is not a "compoun" built by atoms (like a LEGO game), but rather, a cloud of electrons moving in a field of nuclei. This means that electrons do not move in orbitals spanning a single atom, but instead, they usually span many atoms.

!Electrons in benzene

|Benzene has two PI orbitals with the same energy that could each be considered as the HOMO. 

Whether you look at only one, or to the sum of both of them, the electrons are delocalized and spread over the molecule spanning more than one atom center. 

If you look at both of them together, their sum spans all the aromatic ring... in a shape that is similar to the lower energy PI orbital just below them. 

Bottom line is: PI electrons in benzene are moving all around the [http://academics.keene.edu/rblatchly/OrgoCommon/hand/aromatic/AromaticMO.html aromatic ring].

This is specially important with valence electrons (reactive electrons) as it defines the chemically active regions of a molecule. An obvious example is provided by aromatic rings or metal compounds. But there is even more: electrons are not "static" in an orbital: they can store or release energy by "jumping" to alternate orbitals, and this behaviour has a major biological role in many situations (like while you read this, in chromophores, vision, photsynthesis, etc...).

This kind of properties can only be modeled at a subatomic level, i. e.  using QM.

Finally, we can try to add a dynamic component and model the process by which chemical reactions occur, analyzing them with minute detail to compute relevant parameters, like reaction constants, rates, energy landscapes, etc... and understand their behaviour under different conditions, identifying relvent pieces (e. g. amino acids in the active site of an enzyme), and modeling the reaction using various environments (with or without catalysts, with various point mutations, with differerent substrates, etc..).

This is useful for much more than simply earning a better understanding of molecular behaviour: it helps us, for instance, to identify and quantify the effects of change, like different mutations (and hence plan site-directed mutagenesis experiments), substrates (and select better drug candidates), in a word, carry out analysis with a direct impact in our quality of life (and our pockets).

If is precisely because of these advantages, and considering that we have more powerful computing systems every day, that you should be interested in following this path across the different calculation methods available: the rewards to reap are potentially enormous.
