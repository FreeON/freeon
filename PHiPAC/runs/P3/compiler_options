%% Template of the Compiler-Options Specification File
%% 
%% 
%% This file specifies the optimization options for the compiler that
%% the search script should try.
%% 
%% Each line specifies a combination of options.  The format for each
%% line is
%% 	tag:	options_string
%% where "tag" is a tag-suffix appended to the output file of that
%% compiler/option combination, "options_string" is the list of compiler
%% options to be passed to that compiler.  Lines beginning with "%" are
%% comments and are ignored by the search script.  It is usual to specify
%% just one (or two) combination(s) of compiler optimization options for
%% a search.
