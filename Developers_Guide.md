Structure of the Program Suite
------------------------------

FreeON is split into front-end and a back-end. The back-end involves numerically challenging tasks like matrix-multiplication, and matrix-build operations. Back-end operations can always be run in stand-alone mode for tuning and debugging very large problems (ie. so you don't have to redo a month long calculation to debug). Data is passed on the argument line to back-end subprograms, and structures are communicated via an archived HDF file.
