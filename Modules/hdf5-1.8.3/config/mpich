# This file should be sourced into configure if the compiler is the
# MPICH compiler script. It is careful not to do anything if the compiler
# is not MPICH.

# Check if mpicc can support complicated derived datatype correctly.
# We know that mpich 1.2.4 and 1.2.5 do not support it correctly.  We assume
# older versions do not work either.  We don't know of a way of testing its
# correctness without the risk of hanging the configure process.  So, we
# set the configure variable hdf5_mpi_complex_derived_datatype_works to no.
# Notice that this code works only if the mpicc compiler shows its $MPIVERSION
# properly.  It is confirmed mpicc does that as far back as v1.2.3.

# mpich2 do not support it correctly.  But mpich2 reports small version number
# indistiguishable from mpich.  Some mpich2 reports blank, some reports 1.0.2.
