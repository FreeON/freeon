************************************************************************

Notes: This short instruction is written for users who want to quickly build 
       HDF5 library and tools from the HDF5 source code package with Microsoft 
       Visual Studio 2005 but do not want to know HDF5 building and installation 
       details on Windows XP.
         
       For detailed HDF5 build and install information, or if you have trouble 
       following any steps in the instructions, please refer to 
       INSTALL_Windows.txt for further information.
      
       For users who would like to build and test HDF5 package from the
       command line, please refer to INSATLL_Windows_From_Command_Line.txt.
       
       Notes:
       
         1. HDF5 1.8 can also be built using Visual Studio 2005 on Windows
            Vista.  For details, please see Section X of INSTALL_Windows.txt.
            
         2. 64-bit builds are also supported in Visual STudio 2005.  For details
            please see Section IX of INSTALL_Windows.txt.
            
         3. Fortran libraries can be built with Visual Studio 2005 and Intel
            Fortran 9.1.  For details, see Section VI of INSTALL_Windows.txt.

WARNINGS:

Please read CAREFULLY about HDF5 build and install preconditions and 
notes in INSTALL_Windows.txt before starting below procedures.


========================================================================
                            Preconditions                                                           
========================================================================                          

   1. Set up path for external libraries and headers                     
                                                                         
      Skip this part if you don't want to use ANY compression features provided 
      by HDF5.  Please do read Section V in INSTALL_Windows.txt.                         
                                                                         
      You have to read this part even if you want to only use Zlib or Szip.  You 
      also need to read Section V in INSTALL_Windows.txt.                           
                                                                         
      Invoke Microsoft Visual Studio and go to "Tools" and select "Options". In 
      the left pane of  "Option" window poped up, choose and expand "Projects", 
      Click on "VC++ Directories".  In the right pane, Find the box "Show 
      directories for", choose "Include files", if you can not find your Zlib 
      and Szip header path (for example, c:\zlib123\include, c:\szip\include)
      from the directory list, add the header path (c:\zlib123\include, 
      c:\szip\include) to the included directories.                                                
                                                                         
      Find the box "Show directories for", choose "Library files", If you cannot 
      find your Zlib and Szip library path (for example, c:\zlib123\dll, 
      c:\szip\dll) from the directory list, add the library path 
      (c:\zlib123\dll, c:\szip\dll) to the library directories.            

========================================================================
          Building HDF5 C/C++ Libraries with Visual Studio 2005
========================================================================

   1. Run batch file copy_hdf.bat

      Go to  c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\windows and run copy_hdf.bat. This process will 
      copy all the necessary batch files, windows specific source codes and 
      text files saved under c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\windows directory to the 
      corresponding directories under hdf5.

   2. Invoke Microsoft Visual Studio compiler

      Invoke Microsoft Visual Studio.  From the main menu, go to "File" and 
      select the "Open Solution" option. Then open the
      c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\windows\proj\all\all.sln solution if you are building
      without Fortran libraries, or 
      c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\windows\proj\all_fortran\all_fortran.sln if you would
      like to use Fortran.

      You should find Windows project files listed as "all", "big", etc. on the
      left.


   3. (Optional) Disable HDF5 C++ and High level C++
   
      In HDF5 1.8, C++ and HL C++ libraries are built by default.  To opt-out,
      you must explicitly disable them.

      3.1 Skip this step if you do want to build HDF5 High-Level C++ libraries

          Go to "Project" and select "Project Dependencies".  Select "all", and 
          disable all of the following projects:

            hdf5_hl_cpp
            hdf5_hl_cppdll
            hl_test_table_cpp
            hl_test_table_cppdll
      
      3.2 Skip this step if you do want to build HDF5 High-Level libraries

          Go to "Project" and select "Project Dependencies".  Select "all", and 
          disable all of the project files listed in the previous step, as well
          as the following projects:

             hdf5_hl
             hdf5_hldll
             hl_test_image
             hl_test_imagedll
             hl_test_lite
             hl_test_litedll
             hl_test_table
             hl_test_tabledll
             hl_test_ds
             hl_test_dsdll
             hl_test_packet
             hl_test_packetdll
   
   Click on "OK", From the main menu, choose "Build"-> "Build" or  
   "Rebuild ALL" to build both release and debug version of HDF5   
   Libraries.                                                                                           
             

   4. Select "Build", then Select "Configuration Manager".

      4.1 To build debug static libraries, debug multithreaded DLLs, and tests:

      In "Active Solution Configuration", select "Debug". Select "Close". 
      Select "Build" -> "Build Solution" or "Rebuild Solution" to build debug 
      version of project "all".

      4.2 To build release static libraries, multithreaded DLLs and tests:

      In "Active Solution Configuration", select "Release". Select "Close". 
      Select "Build" -> "Build Solution" or "Rebuild Solution" to build release 
      version of project "all".

      Both debug and release versions must be built.

      Warning messages can be ignored.
             
========================================================================
               Testing HDF5 C/C++ Libraries with VS .NET
========================================================================

HDF5 libraries and tools should be tested to make sure that they were
built correctly. c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\hdf5check.bat was provided to test
HDF5 libraries and tools.

hdf5check.bat has four options:
   
   hdf5check                     test HDF5 C library and tools only
      
   hdf5check enablecpp           test HDF5 C/C++ libraries and tools
         
   hdf5check enablefortran       test HDF5 C/Fortran libraries and tools
         
   hdf5check enableall           test HDF5 C/C++/Fortran libraries and tools
   

Notes: Users who only build HDF5 C/C++ libraries ONLY have the first 
       two options.

Invoke a command prompt window and run hdf5check with appropriate option.
Users are encouraged to pipe the test output into a file.  You should find
no "*FAILED*" marks.

If you want to test HDF5 libraries and tools one by one, please refer to
Section II, step 2 in INSTALL_Windows.txt.


========================================================================
                    Installing HDF5 C/C++ Libraries
========================================================================

Run the batch file c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\installhdf5lib.bat to install 
all HDF5 libraries and tools into c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\hdf5lib directory.

========================================================================
               Building HDF5 Examples and Applications
========================================================================

Building HDF5 Examples is Optional. Please read Section II, step 4 and 
the following part in INSTALL_Windows.txt for detailed information.
