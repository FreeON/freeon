Superposed molecular orbitals of the last two electrons in excited Carbon (multiplicity=3). The upper energy two electrons occupy each alone one P orbital. This image shows how the last two electrons are distributed. This is in contrast with the normal atom, where both electrons fit inside a single P orbital. Computed using Orca, RHF, multiplicity=3, B3LYP, 6-31G\* and displayed using Gabedit. (C) by Jos√© R. Valverde, EMBnet/CNB, CSIC, 2012. Released under GNU FDL.
