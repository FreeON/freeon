Sample calculation of O<sub>2</sub> excited state.
--------------------------------------------------

![](O2.png "O2.png")

In this page we will look into a sample calculation on the molecule of O<sub>2</sub> in an excited state with two unpaired electrons. You can find the complete file in the **examples** subdirectory of FreeON distribution.

### Calculation Title

Every FreeON calculation can have an optional title. It is enclosed in between the *<BeginTitle>* and *<EndTitle>* tags. It is advisable to include here as much information about your computation as possible, since it will allow you to remember what it was all about later on (possibly months or years) when you need to review the resuilts (e. g. you are finally writing your PhD dissertation, or a paper and want to recover that calculation you did at the very start of the project, so long, oh, so long ago). Of course it should contain at least the name of the molecule, but including details or ASCII depictions about the structure, the dates of the computation, the experimental context and why you did it, will also help.

In this case, since this is an example file, it contains the name of the molecule, and sample calculation results that you can use to verify that the run completed successfully:

    <BeginTitle>
                   ** Oxygen **

    STO-3G, d=1.194828
     Ref  : E(UHF) = -147.632942003 S**2 = 2.0034
     Mondo: E(UHF) = -147.63294196  S**2 = 2.00341 !verytight

    6-31G, d=1.194828
     Ref  : E(UHF) = -149.545838043 S**2 = 2.0328
     Mondo: E(UHF) = -149.54583803  S**2 = 2.03282 !verytight

    6-31G, GeoOpt
     Ref  : E(UHF) = -149.545838043 S**2 = 2.0328  d = 1.194828
     Mondo: E(UHF) = -149.545838024 S**2 = 2.03282 d = 1.194800 !verytight

    <EndTitle>

### Calculation Options

Calculation options are described in a separate block, which is enclosed by the *<BeginOptions>* and *<EndOptions>* tags. Here is where we describe all the characteristics of the calculations to be made: molecule characteristics, kind of calculation, precision, basis sets to use, etc...

In this case, it looks like this:

    <BeginOptions>
    Charge=0
    Multiplicity=3
    Grad=(Optimize,PrimInt,BiSect,NoGDIIS)
    DebugAll=(MaxDebug,CheckSums)
    Guess=SuperPos
    SCFMethod=(RH,RH)
    BasisSets=(STO-3G-SPLIT,6-31G-SPLIT)
    ModelChem=(HF,HF)
    Accuracy =(verytight,verytight)
    SCFConvergence=(DIIS,DIIS)
    <EndOptions>

In general, FreeON syntax is self-descriptive, so it is very easy to understand. Let us review this example line by line:

    Charge=0

This tells FreeON the total net charge of the system, which in this case is zero. You can try to run simulations on O<sub>2</sub> ionic forms by changing this value accordingly, for instance, you could run a calculation on the O<sub>2</sub><up-</sub> radical by changing the Charge to .-1.

    Multiplicity=3

This tells FreeON about the molecule's spin [multiplicity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicity_(chemistry)). As the charge is zero, it means that all protons are equilibrated with their corresponding electrons. Under normal circumstances, in the ground state, the electrons will dispose themselves in pairs on each molecular orbital filling them from the lowest energy level up to a fully stable molecule. But this is not what we want: we are interested in studying the excited state of the molecule. UNder excitation, one electron from the outer shell may "jump" to a higher energy level orbital. When this happens, we will end up with an orbital that has lost one electron (leaving the other unpaired) and a new occupied orbital with also only one electron. In summary, we have the same number of electrons as the normal molecule (charge=0), but two unpaired electrons. As multiplilty is defined as the number of spin unpaired electrons + 1, that leaves us with a spin multiplicity of 3.
