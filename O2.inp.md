### Calculation Title

Every FreeON calculation can have an optional title. It is enclosed in between the *<BeginTitle>* and *<EndTitle>* tags. It is advisable to include here as much information about your computation as possible, since it will allow you to remember what it was all about later on (possibly months or years) when you need to review the resuilts (e. g. you are finally writing your PhD dissertation, or a paper and want to recover that calculation you did at the very start of the project, so long, oh, so long ago). Of course it should contain at least the name of the molecule, but including details or ASCII depictions about the structure, the dates of the computation, the experimental context and why you did it, will also help.

In this case, since this is an example file, it contains the name of the molecule, and sample calculation results that you can use to verify that the run completed successfully:

    <BeginTitle>
                   ** Oxygen **

    STO-3G, d=1.194828
     Ref  : E(UHF) = -147.632942003 S**2 = 2.0034
     Mondo: E(UHF) = -147.63294196  S**2 = 2.00341 !verytight

    6-31G, d=1.194828
     Ref  : E(UHF) = -149.545838043 S**2 = 2.0328
     Mondo: E(UHF) = -149.54583803  S**2 = 2.03282 !verytight

    6-31G, GeoOpt
     Ref  : E(UHF) = -149.545838043 S**2 = 2.0328  d = 1.194828
     Mondo: E(UHF) = -149.545838024 S**2 = 2.03282 d = 1.194800 !verytight

    <EndTitle>

As you can see, you are pretty much free to write anything in the title section. Use with wisely to annotate your calculations fro future reference, by you and by others.

### Calculation Options

Calculation options are described in a separate block, which is enclosed by the *<BeginOptions>* and *<EndOptions>* tags. Here is where we describe all the characteristics of the calculations to be made: molecule characteristics, kind of calculation, precision, basis sets to use, etc...

In this case, it looks like this:

    <BeginOptions>
    Charge=0
    Multiplicity=3
    Grad=(Optimize,PrimInt,BiSect,NoGDIIS)
    DebugAll=(MaxDebug,CheckSums)
    Guess=SuperPos
    SCFMethod=(RH,RH)
    BasisSets=(STO-3G-SPLIT,6-31G-SPLIT)
    ModelChem=(HF,HF)
    Accuracy =(verytight,verytight)
    SCFConvergence=(DIIS,DIIS)
    <EndOptions>

In general, FreeON syntax is self-descriptive, so it is very easy to understand. Let us review this example line by line:

    Charge=0

This tells FreeON the total net charge of the system, which in this case is zero. You can try to run simulations on O<sub>2</sub> ionic forms by changing this value accordingly, for instance, you could run a calculation on the O<sub>2</sub><up-</sub> radical by changing the Charge to .-1.

    Multiplicity=3

This tells FreeON about the molecule's spin [multiplicity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicity_(chemistry)). As the charge is zero, it means that all protons are equilibrated with their corresponding electrons. Under normal circumstances, in the ground state, the electrons will dispose themselves in pairs on each molecular orbital filling them from the lowest energy level up to a fully stable molecule. But this is not what we want: we are interested in studying the excited state of the molecule. UNder excitation, one electron from the outer shell may "jump" to a higher energy level orbital. When this happens, we will end up with an orbital that has lost one electron (leaving the other unpaired) and a new occupied orbital with also only one electron. In summary, we have the same number of electrons as the normal molecule (charge=0), but two unpaired electrons. As multiplilty is defined as the number of spin unpaired electrons + 1, that leaves us with a spin multiplicity of 3.

The next lines come about in a certainly *ad hoc* order. This reflects the fact that FreeON does nor enforce you to follow a strict ordering when entering options. The program has safe defaults for most of them, and anyway, will process all the section before getting to work, so you are free to state options in any order you like. It is best if you define an order that is logical for you and you can always remember (this will ensure you develop a routine and make it more difficult to make mistakes or forget some odd detail).

    Grad=(Optimize,PrimInt,BiSect,NoGDIIS)

This line tells FreeON how to compute gradients during optimization steps. See the reference pages for a more detailed explanation, but for now, it is enough to notice that you can combine several gradient analysis methods for the different calculation steps, e. g. you can start with a fast but less accurate approach that will be later followed by a more accurate, but slower approach.

    DebugAll=(MaxDebug,CheckSums)

This line tells FreeON to include in the output additional information. You will normally not use this. It is intended mainly for the developers of the software so they can track a calculation and spot where is any problem in the unlikely case that it went wrong, so they can fix the code. It may occasionally, though very unlikely, be useful for you to verify a calculation, but as mentioned, you will normally not use this option.

    Guess=SuperPos

Here we tell FreeON how to start the calculation, We could start our search for the optimal coefficients from any random value, but it is better to start from something that is closer to the solution, such as a prior quick Huckel calculation, as it will converge faster to the solution. In this case we are asking FreeON to use the SuperPos ([Superposition of Atomic Densities, SAD](http://igitur-archive.library.uu.nl/chem/2007-0302-200920/pdf18.pdf)) method to generate the starting configuration.

    SCFMethod=(RH,RH)

We are now specifying the kind of calculation: **RH** stands for Restricted Hartree-Fock. Notice that we are not specifying which kind of restricted Hartree-Fock calculation we want. We could, but if we don't, as is the case, the program will select the appropriate calculation for us. Normally, we will run our calculation in three steps: first get an initial approximation with some rule of thumb or relatively simple approach, then we will run an approximate, quick calculation using a reduced basis set, and finally we will run an accurate calculation starting from the previous calculation results. We already told the program which approach to use for the initial guess, here we tell FreeON which methods to use for the approximate and the accurate calculations (Restricted Hartree-Fock in each case, but we could combine methods if we wanted).

    BasisSets=(STO-3G-SPLIT,6-31G-SPLIT)

What will make the difference between the initial and final calculations is the [basis set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_set_(chemistry)) chosen. The first, approximate, calculation will use the well known STO-3G basis set, and the final, fine calculation will use a split 6-31G basis set.

    ModelChem=(HF,HF)

This line states the methods to use to solve the SCF equations. In this case we obviously want to use the [Hartree-Fock method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartreeâ€“Fock_method) in both cases. In other types of calculations we could have chosen e. g. the Slater, Slater-Dirac, or different correlation exchange methods.

    Accuracy =(verytight,verytight)

This line indicates the convergence criteria. We are going to ask for very accurate convergence here. This is acceptable for very small systems, such as this one. For bigger systems you may need to start with less accurate calculations for the initial phase and then try to increase precision in the second refinement stage. For very large systems you even may not be able to aim for such very tight convergence criteria and need to compromise with less stringent ones.

    SCFConvergence=(DIIS,DIIS)

The final option used in this example defines the method used for SCF convergence. We will use the [DIIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIIS) (direct inversion of iterated subspace) method in botth the initial and final calculations.

### Molecular geometry

The final section in this example is the actual molecule geometry:

    <BeginGeometry>
     o   0.000000 0.0 0.0 
     o   1.300000 0.0 0.0 
    <EndGeometry>

The geometry is provided by stating each atom name followed by its X Y and Z coordinates. If you look at this very closely you will discover that this is indeed a very simple format. Well, you do not really need to look at it that closely, do you? It is even simpler than the well known [XYZ format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XYZ_file_format), as we do not need to provide the number of atoms or the comment line. It is worth noting for one reason: if you have your molecule in XYZ format (as produced by [OpenBabel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBabel)), all you need to do is strip the first two lines (number of atoms and comment) to get a valid geometry for inclusion in this section of FreeON.

Note as well that FreeON does not care if the atom name is written in capitals or not. It will take and understand it all the same.
