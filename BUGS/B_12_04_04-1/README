Lattice-JForce differs for serial and parallel versions.

MONDO version used:  2004-11-30 07:25
Serial: Compiled on zinc with CompilerSpecifics.IntelLinux.NAG .
Parallel: Compiled on Q by CompilerSpecifics.True64.COMPAQ.

This is a urea molecule, 2x2x2 cell.
HF/3-21G gives different JForces for the Lattice in parallel vs serial 
runs.

Printout in the output files refers to cumulated lattice forces. 
Difference happens to JForce, but also, small difference (about 15%) 
is also observed in ONX Forces.
I'll print individual force components too for J and ONX lattice forces.
SDCs.F90 as checked in here containes the printouts as compared 
to version 2004-11-30 07:25 .
