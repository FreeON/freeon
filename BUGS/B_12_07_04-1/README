Another calculation that is a complete desaster.
Boron nitride in HF/3-21G/good. 

The elementary cell is 
about 10x10 angstroems in each direction.

Gradients at first geometry are extremely large.
Note that SCF has not converged properly. Seems to be 
a similar case to polyethilene (BUGS/B_12_01_04-1).
