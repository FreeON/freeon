Messed up forces, seems like things are uninitialized.

PROBLEM: 
When running code on T01.water.inp and printing force conponents
lots of NaN-s appear, e.g. in S-Force. For CH2x-6.inp
instead of NaN-s, the run produces very large numbers like 10^+270 
or so. While the NaN-s do not mess up atomic forces for water,
they do for CH2x-6.inp. See output for water in T01_2873.out,
output for CH2x-6.inp is in CH2x-6_23449.out-2. For the CH2x-6.inp
the restart hdf is CH2x-6_11756.hdf.gz.

Printouts of forces are in the output files as produced by the SCFs.F90
given in the present directory. This SCFs.F90 is the same with version
2004-12-06 08:02, but some printing is added.

Also, why was SCF convergence for such a simple electronic structure
as polyethylene such a struggle (see CH2x-6_9156.out-1)?

NaN-forces need to be fixed.
