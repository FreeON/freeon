Compiled on zinc with NAG.

SCF convergence problem on CH2_8 in HF/3-21G/tight.

CJ has fixed the same problem on CH2_6, hower his fix does not seem
to work on CH2_8. Attached files have been calculated 
on zinc on a single processor.

Something is really strange in SCF, see how SCF energy blows up.
Even if one exchanges DIIS to ODA, the same thing happens.
