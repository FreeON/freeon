Sever problem with SCF convergence on a simple system.

MONDO version used:  2004-11-30 07:25

This is a polyethilene molecule.
HF/3-21G could not converge with the default SCF convergence algorithm.
The initial STO-2G phase converged well, but the forthcoming 3-21G 
did not, at all.
Starting from 3-21G did not converge either. 
SCFConvergence=(DIIS) was cathasrophic.

For such a simple saturated alkane SCF convergence sould be 
absolutely smooth in any basis set.
