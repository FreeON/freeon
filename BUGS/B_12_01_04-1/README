Sever problem with SCF convergence on a simple system.
This is a polyethilene molecule.
HF/3-21G could not converge with the default SCF convergence algorithm.
The initial STO-2G phase converged well, but the forthcoming 3-21G 
did not, at all.
Starting from 3-21G did not converge either. 

For such a simple saturated alkane SCF convergence suld be 
absolutely smooth in any basis.
