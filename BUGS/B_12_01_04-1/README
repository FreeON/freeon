PROBLEM: 
HF/3-21G/good on polyethilene.
After a very difficult SCF convergence force conponents are printed.
It turns out that already S-Force contains extremely large 
component in 3-21G basis, while it did not, say, in STO-2G.
See force components in CH2x-6_27129.out-2 .

Running the calculation in RH instead of TC2 does not change the 
forces at all, the same big forces are found.

For printing, the attached SCFs.F90 was used. Beside the extra 
printing it is identical to version 2004-12-06 08:02.

Also, why was SCF convergence for such a simple electronic structure
as polyethylene such a struggle in 3-21G (see CH2x-6_9156.out-1)?

Fixing of huge force components is needed.
