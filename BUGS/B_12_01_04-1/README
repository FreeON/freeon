Messed up forces, seems like things are uninitialized.

PROBLEM: 
HF/3-21G/good on polyethilene.
After a very difficult SCF convergence force conponents are printed.
It turns out that already S-Force contains extremely large 
component is 3-21G basis, while it did not, say, in STO-2G.

For printing, the attached SCFs.F90 was used. Beside the extra 
printing it is identical to version 2004-12-06 08:02.

Also, why was SCF convergence for such a simple electronic structure
as polyethylene such a struggle (see CH2x-6_9156.out-1)?

Fixing of huge force components is needed.
