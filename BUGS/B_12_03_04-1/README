MONDO version approx beginning of nov, compiled on zinc with NAG.

BASIC PROBLEM:
The bug appears when running MONDO on halite-2-repeat.inp.
The symptom is that forces are enormously large at this geometry,
see in halite-2_8229-repeat.out .
A list of all Cartesian forces can be found at "GradNew%D"
in halite-2_8229-repeat.out. 

ADDITIONAL INFO:
Note, that the energy looks reasonable. The input geometry was 
created by an optimization step in halite_28022.out-1 .
While energies change reasonably, the force makes a huge jump at 
the second geometry. In forthcoming geometries gradients are OK again.
